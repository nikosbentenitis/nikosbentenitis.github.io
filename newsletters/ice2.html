<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7832" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-feature.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-feature.jpg 700w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-feature-300x129.jpg 300w" alt="Premium Feature Image" width="700" height="300" /></p>
<p>This report covers macro conditions, comments on bonds and gold and bitcoin, updates the various portfolios, looks at the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) stock, and then finishes with an ETF that invests in a lot of exchanges and royalty companies around the world.</p>
<h2>Macro View</h2>
<p>The virus is on the decline in most places in terms of daily cases, daily deaths, and those currently hospitalized for the virus.</p>
<p>Here are the numbers for current virus hospitalizations in the US, which is my preferred metric:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12052" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-hospitalizations.png" alt="Hospitalizations" width="650" height="400" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-hospitalizations.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-hospitalizations-300x185.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>Interestingly, although Japan has intentionally been much slower to roll out the vaccine than many other countries due to additional tests to ensure the vaccine is safe, their virus case count rolled over at the same time and went deeply down as well, so it seems to be another global seasonal roll-over aside from the vaccine.</p>
<p>In recent days though, Japan did begin vaccinations as well, with the Summer Olympics as a catalyst to get started on that project despite relatively low per-capita death counts compared to the western nations.</p>
<p>What many folks are hoping for, is that with the vaccines being rolled out in many places, this will have been the last spike of cases/hospitalizations/deaths. If that goes as expected, as this year progresses and turns into next year, the virus would become like the flu, with variants and seasonality that we all live with, but not at any severity that leads to changes in human behavior or government lockdowns.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, US national personal income had a second spike higher, due to the second round of stimulus checks:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12041" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-personal-income.png" alt="Personal Income" width="730" height="450" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-personal-income.png 730w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-personal-income-300x185.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" /></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: St. Louis Fed</em></p>
<p>Usually incomes go down in a recession as folks lose their income or get flat/cut wages for a period of time, but for this cycle, government transfer payments in the form of stimulus checks and federal unemployment insurance have been keeping incomes topped up above baseline levels.</p>
<p>So far, the US has been the biggest fiscal spender as a percentage of GDP and growth in broad money supply, compared to developed peers.</p>
<p>Congress is currently working on a $1.9 trillion aid package that includes a third round of stimulus checks and several more months of federal unemployment insurance, which will result in a third spike in personal income if it is passed. The House just completed it and sent it to the Senate. The Senate is pretty tight between Democrats and Republicans, so it&#8217;ll require some negotiations for all 50 Democrats to agree on a bill to pass, with Kamala Harris as the tiebreaker vote. Overall, it looks probable by mid-March.</p>
<p><strong>The US Business Cycle Heatmap</strong></p>
<p>If we take a broad view of the US economy and break it down part by part, we see some divergences. The economic bottom was in Q2 2020, but from there, some areas have bounced back more than others. Retail sales, capital spending, and construction spending have been the strong areas. Jobs and exports have been the weakest areas.</p>
<p>Here is my updated heatmap of various economic indicators for the U.S. economy over the past five years, measured in year-over-year percent change terms. This lets us see a broad spectrum of the economy rather than cherry pick good or bad data points to fit a narrative:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12058" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-economic-heatmap.png" alt="Economic Heatmap" width="687" height="613" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-economic-heatmap.png 687w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-economic-heatmap-300x268.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 687px) 100vw, 687px" /></p>
<p>The chart starts from the bottom and goes up over five years, and each column represents one of the economic indicators.</p>
<p>For most of the chart, I use a green/yellow/red color spectrum. Green indicates solid growth, yellow indicates medium, and orange/red indicate slow growth or contraction, relative to the rest of the 5-year period for that indicator. In other words, green is good and red is bad.</p>
<p>For inflation CPI, there is a separate blue/white/red color scale, because high or low inflation is not necessarily “good” or “bad” in the same way as the rest of the heat map. Red indicates higher price inflation, white indicates medium, and blue is lower price inflation, relative to the 5-year period. Economic slowdowns tend to be dis-inflationary while economic booms tend to be pro-inflationary, but there are also some business cycles that slow down with high inflation, and thus become “stagflationary”. So, inflation gets its own color scheme.</p>

<h2>Bonds and Gold Note</h2>
<p>Normally, bonds aren&#8217;t the most exciting market, but last week had fireworks. Here&#8217;s the 10-year yield over the past year:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12040" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-10yr-yield.png" alt="10 Year Yield" width="746" height="468" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-10yr-yield.png 746w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-10yr-yield-300x188.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 746px) 100vw, 746px" /></p>
<p>Treasury yields remain historically low by absolute terms, but year-to-date 2021 has seen a sharp rise in yields, and Thursday in particular saw an unusually rapid rise. In other words, there has been significant demand weakness in bonds, resulting in lower bond prices and higher yields.</p>
<p>This correlated with a significant sell-off in stocks and other assets as well. My <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/interest-rate-effects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article on interest rate effects on equities</a> goes into some detail as to why interest rates and equity valuations have significant inverse correlation.</p>
<p>A year-long chart of the Treasury market doesn&#8217;t really do the last week much justice. For folks watching the bond market in real-time intraday, last week was intense:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12039" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-bond-meltdown.png" alt="Bond Meltdown" width="634" height="1584" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-bond-meltdown.png 634w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-bond-meltdown-120x300.png 120w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-bond-meltdown-410x1024.png 410w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-bond-meltdown-615x1536.png 615w" sizes="(max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px" /></p>
<p>Things settled down by the end of Thursday and eased Friday as well. However, this was quite an event. There are many funds out there that use stocks and bonds together with leverage, so they have to forcibly sell assets and deleverage when volatility picks up like this, which can result in those weird spikes in yields.</p>
<p>This wasn&#8217;t just in the United States, but rather occurred to bond markets across the world. In response, a number of central banks made comments about watching the long end of their bond curves. The Reserve Bank of Australia performed a massive daily purchase of bonds on Thursday to try to maintain their yield curve control rate peg on their 3-year note.</p>
<p>I cautioned about this mounting yield issue in my <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/february-2021-newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public newsletter</a> last weekend.</p>
<p>The rise in bond yields is also putting pressure on gold, since gold&#8217;s biggest correlation is with inflation-adjusted 10-year Treasury yields. With bond yields spiking faster than inflation expectations, that means real yields are going up (albeit still negative):</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12053" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-gold-vs-real-rates.png" alt="Gold vs Real Rates" width="730" height="450" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-gold-vs-real-rates.png 730w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-gold-vs-real-rates-300x185.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" /></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: St. Louis Fed</em></p>
<p>My long-term base case is for inflation to pick up, yields to rise and start causing problems (much like Thursday, but more persistently), until more central banks attempt various types of yield curve control like Australia is doing.</p>
<p>If the US Federal Reserve does outright yield curve control at some point or otherwise suppresses yields, that should be rocket fuel for gold, bitcoin, and the broader commodity space. In the meantime, bank stocks should do reasonably well in a steepening yield environment, except of course on days where there is forced-selling of stocks across the board. That is why I like to hold both bank stocks and gold assets, as well as other commodities, at the current time.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve received a number of emails about gold, since it has been in a correction since the end of August 2020. After being long gold since Q4 2018, I rotated slightly towards other commodities since mid-2020, but remain long gold and gold stocks to a moderate extent because I think there&#8217;s a decent probability that this cycle ends with some sort of yield curve control in the US, and deeper than -1% real yields.</p>
<p>I like to diversify my commodity exposure, with gold, silver, platinum, uranium, copper, iron, energy, and bitcoin, since they don&#8217;t all do well at the same time. Lately most of them are doing well except gold, which is being held down by these rising nominal yields for the time being. I continue to view gold as fairly-valued vs the growth in the broad money supply, and having a well-deserved correction after a major move.</p>
<p>This chart shows the gold price and broad money supply per capita, normalized to 100 in 1973. It also has inflation-adjusted 10-year yields as an overlay for context.</p>

<p><strong>Upcoming Dates and Possible SLR Extension</strong></p>
<p>There are a few dates to watch in the coming weeks as it relates to bonds, which then have downstream implications for the dollar, gold, stocks, and bitcoin.</p>
<p>March 4th: Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to give a public talk.</p>
<p>March 17th: Fed FOMC meeting, where they may adjust Fed policy.</p>
<p>There are a few things the market is looking for with regard to either of these two dates in particular. It&#8217;s more than psychological because some of the decisions will impact the plumbing of the financial system.</p>
<p>One is whether the Fed will extend a supplementary leverage ratio &#8220;SLR&#8221; rule change, which was put in place last year during the crisis and is set to expire next month on March 31st. This was a temporary program over the past year to basically allow banks to buy more Treasuries. JP Morgan had a <a href="https://am.jpmorgan.com/sg/en/asset-management/liq/insights/liquidity-insights/updates/a-federal-reserve-announcement-provides-temporary-relief-to-banks-on-leverage-and-capital-adequacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good overview</a> of it last year:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12075" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-slr-explanation.png" alt="SLR Explanation" width="700" height="361" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-slr-explanation.png 700w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-slr-explanation-300x155.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>

<p>In late 2019, the plumbing of the US financial system ran into a bottleneck, resulting in a spike in the overnight lending rate. Basically, there were too many T-bills flooding the system compared to bank reserves. The Fed had to respond by ending its balance sheet reduction and moving to indefinite balance sheet expansion, creating new bank reserves to buy some of the T-bills on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>And then during the pandemic crisis several months later, with massive Treasury issuance and Fed balance sheet expansion about to happen, the Fed changed the rules for the supplementary leverage ratio so that banks could buy more Treasuries and similar assets. This chart shows US bank holdings of Treasuries:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12076" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-slr-chart.png" alt="SLR UST Chart" width="700" height="437" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-slr-chart.png 700w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-slr-chart-300x187.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: St. Louis Fed</em></p>
<p>If the government passes the $1.9 trillion aid package, that&#8217;ll result in a lot of net Treasury security issuance later this year. The foreign sector isn&#8217;t buying many Treasuries; they only accumulated about 5% of net Treasuries issued last year. If the SLR rule change expires, banks are limited in how many Treasuries they can hold, so it could be hard to find buyers for all those Treasuries. The Fed is currently buying about $80 billion Treasuries per month, or about $1 trillion expected for the year, which ironically might not be enough compared to the supply.</p>
<p>My base case is that the Fed will be forced to extend the SLR rules change and/or increase its purchase rate of long-duration Treasuries by the end of the year. March 17th is a decent candidate for an announcement of the SLR rule change extension, but we&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p>In other words, buckle up and grab some popcorn. Bonds, stocks, the dollar, gold, and bitcoin are all potentially impacted by Fed decisions later this month. Make sure your asset mix is appropriate for your risk tolerance.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Note</h2>
<p>Bitcoin reached as high as $58,000, along with a market capitalization of just over $1 trillion, before experiencing a second significant correction for this bull cycle.</p>
<p>On an intraday basis, it has gone down to about $43,000, representing about a 25% decline.</p>
<p>On a daily closing basis, the level right below $45,000 is acting as somewhat of a support level:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12090" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-btcusd.png" alt="BTCUSD Chart" width="694" height="532" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-btcusd.png 694w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-btcusd-300x230.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px" /></p>
<p>Overall, this volatility remains normal for a bitcoin bull run. The 2017 bull run had several 30%+ corrections.</p>
<p>The uptick in bond yields last week, and the subsequent drawdown in gold and tech stocks, spilled over into bitcoin here at a time when it was locally overbought anyway. It was a broad risk-off period for markets. If you just skimmed this report for the bitcoin section, I recommend going back and reading the bonds/gold note above, since it&#8217;s relevant.</p>
<p>Structurally, the various on-chain indicators still suggest that we are mid-bull-run for bitcoin, but the macro environment can give that a bit of a test.</p>
<p>For example, the HODL wave which measures whether the price rise has been sufficient to get long-term cold storage holders to sell their coins, still looks great:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12077" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-hodl-wave.png" alt="HODL Wave" width="686" height="710" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-hodl-wave.png 686w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-hodl-wave-290x300.png 290w" sizes="(max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px" /></p>

<p>Similarly, the standard deviation between the market capitalization and realized capitalization (a measure of how far the price is above average cost basis, in a basic way of putting it) looks fine:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12078" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-bitcoin-mvrv.png" alt="Bitcoin MVRV" width="692" height="727" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-bitcoin-mvrv.png 692w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-bitcoin-mvrv-286x300.png 286w" sizes="(max-width: 692px) 100vw, 692px" /></p>

<p><strong>Yellow Light from the SOPR</strong></p>
<p>One of the more concerning indicators to watch at this time is the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR). This ratio tracks whether entities are selling at a profit or a loss on average. When the ratio is over 1, it means entities are on average selling for a profit. When the ratio is below 1, it means they are on average selling for a loss.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12070" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-full-sopr.png" alt="Full SOPR" width="700" height="393" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-full-sopr.png 700w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-full-sopr-300x168.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: Glassnode</em></p>
<p>During bear markets, SOPR is often below 1, as plenty of folks sell for a loss and capitulate. During a bull market, SOPR usually stays above 1, and just occasionally dips below 1 during corrections before bouncing back up, since few people are willing to sell at a loss.</p>
<p>SOPR briefly going below 1 in a bull market often indicates that a near-term bottom is in. A bull market doesn&#8217;t turn into a bear market until sentiment turns sour enough that entities begin consistently selling for losses to get out of the position.</p>
<p>After the first cycle, bitcoin has had three post-halving bull runs so far, starting in late-2012, mid-2016, and mid-2020.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12072" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-bitcoin-halving-cycle.png" alt="Bitcoin Halving Cycle" width="667" height="619" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-bitcoin-halving-cycle.png 667w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-bitcoin-halving-cycle-300x278.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: Blockchain.com</em></p>
<p>The first post-halving bull run during the 2013-2014 period occurred in two parts. It went straight up massively, then had a huge multi-month correction, and then went straight up a second time, reaching its halving-cycle major top. Here was what SOPR did:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12071" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-bitcoin-sopr-first.png" alt="Bitcoin First SOPR" width="700" height="393" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-bitcoin-sopr-first.png 700w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-bitcoin-sopr-first-300x168.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: Glassnode</em></p>
<p>The second post-halving bull run occurred during 2016-2017 in one big run, where it went up significantly with short 30%+ corrections along the way. Whenever SOPR went below 1 for a brief period of time, that was generally the end of the correction:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12073" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-bitcoin-sopr-previous.png" alt="Bitcoin SOPR Previous" width="700" height="393" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-bitcoin-sopr-previous.png 700w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-bitcoin-sopr-previous-300x168.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: Glassnode</em></p>
<p>In the third and current post-halving bull run, starting in May 2020 when the supply flow halving occurred, we&#8217;ve seen a similar price history to the 2016-2017 bull run so far, where SOPR has avoided staying below 1 other than for brief periods of time:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12074" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-sopr-current.png" alt="Bitcoin SOPR Current" width="700" height="393" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-sopr-current.png 700w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-sopr-current-300x168.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: Glassnode</em></p>
<p>With SOPR below 1 for the first time since September 2020, this is a pretty critical point for the cycle. If it&#8217;s going to avoid a significant correction, this week is a good time to find a bottom.</p>
<p><strong>Macro Forces</strong></p>
<p>Up against the structural bull market of the post-halving adoption cycle, there are two fundamental headwinds against bitcoin at the moment.</p>
<p>The first is potentially bond yields as described previously. If they keep rising, and the dollar index remains firm, and liquidity gets more tight, that should continue to pressure highly-valued growth stocks, and bitcoin may temporarily be lumped into that category by investors as well, especially in a broad risk-off environment.</p>
<p>The second is that the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) no longer has a positive premium over its net asset value or &#8220;NAV&#8221;. In fact, it&#8217;s trading at a slight discount to NAV. Canada now has a solid bitcoin ETF, firms such as NYDIG and SkyBridge have come to market over time and provided competition for institutional and accredited investor allocations into bitcoin. So, there is less of a reason for GBTC to have a premium. Most existing closed end funds for other asset classes trade at a discount to NAV, and GBTC has at least temporarily joined the discount club.</p>
<p>This discount to NAV is both good and bad. It&#8217;s good because it makes GBTC a better vehicle for holding bitcoin than it used to be, since you&#8217;re getting it at around net asset value rather than at a premium. It&#8217;s bad because it removes one of the sources of bitcoin demand.</p>
<p>GBTC was the biggest buyer of bitcoin in 2020. Some of this was for long exposure, and another big chunk was for market-neutral arbitrage. For that second part, accredited investors and institutions could buy into GBTC at NAV with a six-month lock-up period, and then sell six months later at the market price, and that market price generally had a premium over NAV. Simultaneously with their purchase at NAV, they could short bitcoin elsewhere, and thus make a non-directional investment that simply lets them extract the premium over NAV every six months with no exposure to bitcoin&#8217;s price.</p>
<p>This process made a lot of money for folks, and permanently sucked up a lot of bitcoin. GBTC basically converted liquid bitcoin to illiquid bitcoin, locked away in cold storage. If the GBTC premium remains minimal or negative, that trade is done, and thus that specific source of demand and liquid-to-illiquid conversion process is done.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting and bullish things happening with bitcoin over the past year is how it was sucked off of exchanges, which never happened before. This chart shows bitcoin&#8217;s price in black, and the number of bitcoin on exchanges in orange:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12079" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-exchange-balance.png" alt="Bitcoin Exchange Balance" width="700" height="393" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-exchange-balance.png 700w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-exchange-balance-300x168.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>For its entire existence, the number of bitcoin on exchanges kept increasing, except for a short period in the second half of 2016.</p>
<p>Well, ever since early 2020, the number of coins on exchanges has been decreasing, and for the longest and biggest drawdown ever. This represents all sorts of institutional demand and cold-storage buyers, with PayPal and Cash App and Swan Bitcoin and Grayscale and NYDIG and SkyBridge and a number of corporations buying up bitcoin and removing it from exchanges.</p>
<p>With Grayscale potentially out of the picture, it&#8217;ll be interesting to see if the number of bitcoin on exchanges finally bottoms, or not. It&#8217;ll depend on how much demand there is from these other funds, including new ETFs and ongoing institutional allocations.</p>
<p>Overall, I remain structurally bullish on bitcoin but as we get higher and deeper into this bull market, the risks for reaching a significant top gradually increase. The key things I&#8217;ll be watching in the coming weeks for bitcoin are 1) do bond yields keep rising or do they take a break with something like SLR relief, and 2) does SOPR turn persistently below 1 or does this mark a local bottom.</p>
<p>Avoiding daily closes notably below $45,000, and with an eventual firm price break over $58,000 to new highs, would be very bullish. Ideally, we want to start seeing the price form a rounded bottom and turn up, with the SOPR not remaining persistently below 1.</p>
<p>On the other hand, for bitcoin to begin closing the day below support levels with a persistently weak SOPR, would get messy. The next layer of support is around the $40,000 zone which was the previous local price top.</p>
<h2>Uranium Note</h2>
<p>My <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/premium-2020-10-25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">October 25th report</a> focused on uranium, and I went long Uranium Participation Corp (URPTF) and Cameco (CCJ) around that time.</p>
<p>This entry point was rather fortunate, since the result was pretty explosive:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12055" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-uranium.png" alt="Uranium Performance" width="650" height="433" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-uranium.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-uranium-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>Junior miners did even better.</p>
<p>This past week, I sat down with Marcelo Lopez, CFA of L2 Capital Partners on Real Vision to discuss the uranium sector. He&#8217;s a subject matter expert with a fund devoted to uranium investing (founded within the past few years to take advantage of the bear market), so we walked through the sector with additional detail.</p>
<p>I remain long-term bullish on the sector as a small part of a diversified portfolio, and as one might expect for someone who specifically set up a fund to focus on it, he&#8217;s <em>extremely</em> bullish.</p>
<p>Here is a <a href="https://www.realvision.com/uranium-the-most-asymmetric-trade-ive-seen-in-my-life?utm_source=contributor&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=20210225_LAML_JB_CONT_W1_LINK" target="_blank" rel="noopener">private link</a> to the interview. As usual, out of respect for Real Vision, please don&#8217;t share this on social media as it&#8217;s a link behind their subscription paywall.</p>
<h2>Portfolio Updates</h2>
<p>Here are a number of planned portfolio updates for next week. The full portfolios can be viewed in my Google Drive.</p>
<p><strong>Top 12 List</strong></p>
<p>-Replace Cisco (CSCO) with Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). CSCO remains a hold but is not currently compelling enough to remain on the top 12 list.</p>
<p>-Replace Sandstorm (SAND) with Franco Nevada (FNV). I remain bullish (and long) on SAND, but with the recent underperformance of the gold sector broadly, even the blue chips are getting cheap so it&#8217;s a decent time to upgrade on the top 12 list. FNV is the one set-and-forget royalty company in the gold sector.</p>
<p>For gold, I like FNV, SAND, and WPM as my preferred royalty companies, and remain long all three in various portfolios.</p>

<h2>Portfolio Performance</h2>
<p>I calculated the updated portfolio performances for the end of February, with monthly resolution. They&#8217;re all real-money accounts which makes it straightforward to track.</p>
<p>Two of them (newsletter portfolio and ETF portfolio) are dollar-cost averaged into, so their return charts are displayed as gains over principal.</p>
<p>The other two (fortress income and no limits) began with a starting value and no new funds are added, so they are displayed as total portfolio value.</p>
<p>Because the portfolios are multi-asset, with domestic stocks, foreign stocks, bonds, and alternatives, I use a 2050 lifecycle fund as my primary benchmark. I also put pure equity S&amp;P 500 total returns and MSCI EAFE total returns on the charts as well for reference. The benchmark performances are calculated the same way as the portfolios.</p>
<p>The Newsletter portfolio is the oldest portfolio, and has been one of the strongest. It has notably outperformed the diversified benchmark, and also managed to outperform a pure S&amp;P 500 so far despite holding some T-bills at all times, which is above expectations:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12042" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-newsletter-performance.png" alt="Newsletter Portfolio Performance" width="702" height="600" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-newsletter-performance.png 702w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-newsletter-performance-300x256.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px" /></p>
<p>The Fortress Income portfolio is the second oldest. It has a restriction of emphasizing income-oriented investments, which means we can&#8217;t invest in as much growth/tech. Despite this, it remains above the diversified benchmark in terms of total returns, and nearly in-line with the pure S&amp;P 500:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12043" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-income-performance.png" alt="Income Performance" width="700" height="600" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-income-performance.png 700w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-income-performance-300x257.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>The ETF portfolio also has restrictions in the form of not having individual stocks, but it also has done pretty well:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12044" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-etf-performance.png" alt="ETF Performance" width="700" height="600" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-etf-performance.png 700w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-etf-performance-300x257.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>The No Limits portfolio, which has the fewest restrictions, has experienced the best performance:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12045" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-nolimits-performance.png" alt="No Limits Performance" width="700" height="597" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-nolimits-performance.png 700w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-nolimits-performance-300x256.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>In general, our commodity positions, international equities, value equities, and bitcoin have been providing alpha in recent months. On the other hand, the gold position has been a drag since September, and T-bills give us plenty of optionality but don&#8217;t keep up with the market when it&#8217;s in a strong bull phase.</p>
<h2>Intercontinental Exchange Deep Dive Analysis</h2>
<p>Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) is a company that operates a number of exchanges around the world. The New York Stock Exchange is their most famous asset, and their own stock trades on that exchange.</p>
<p>However, they own far more than just the NYSE. They have a very large position in US futures markets, which involve commodities. They also own a large number of clearing houses. In late 2020, the company acquired Ellie Mae, which is a cloud/SaaS company that processes about a third of US mortgage applications.</p>
<p>ICE divides their operations into three segments: Exchanges, Fixed Income and Data Services, and Mortgage Technology. Here&#8217;s a breakdown of their revenue mix:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12050" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-ice-revenue.png" alt="ICE Revenue" width="492" height="1442" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-ice-revenue.png 492w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-ice-revenue-102x300.png 102w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-ice-revenue-349x1024.png 349w" sizes="(max-width: 492px) 100vw, 492px" /></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: <a href="https://ir.theice.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ICE Q4 2020 Earnings Presentation</a></em></p>
<p>If you look around the world, exchanges did exceptionally well during the 2000s decade and specifically the 2004-2007 commodity bull run. Their earnings and stock prices soared.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t expect a move as big as they had then, but if we do enter a long-term commodity bull market in the 2020s, exchanges should have a nice tailwind, with less volatility than the commodity producers themselves.</p>
<p>Because ICE generates a lot of free cash flow, it has plenty of options for what to do with it. For starters, they pay a growing dividend. Secondly, in years without a major acquisition, they typically buy back shares. In years with a major acquisition, they typically issue some equity as part of the purchase, along with cash and debt.</p>
<p>Until recently, they had less than $8 billion in net long-term debt, which was a debt-to-net-income ratio of about 4x, which is quite reasonable. The acquisition of Ellie Mae was for $11 billion, of which about $8 billion was debt. So, ICE has a debt-to-net-income ratio of roughly 8x now, which is on the high side of my acceptable range, but fair enough compared to the stability and growth of their cash flows.</p>
<p>They should be able to digest this acquisition and deleverage over the next few years, with growing revenue and earnings. The S&amp;P credit rating is BBB+, which puts them in the middle-of-the-road as far as investment grade credit ratings go.</p>
<p><strong>Valuation Analysis</strong></p>
<p>ICE&#8217;s F.A.S.T. Graph shows the remarkable smoothness with which the company grows:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12046" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-ice-fastgraph.png" alt="ICE FASTGraph" width="969" height="587" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-ice-fastgraph.png 969w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-ice-fastgraph-300x182.png 300w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-ice-fastgraph-768x465.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 969px) 100vw, 969px" /></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs</em></p>
<p>This shows up in their raw free cash flow figures as well, rather than being &#8220;managed earnings&#8221;:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12048" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-ice-fcf-fastgraph.png" alt="ICE FCF FASTGraph" width="969" height="587" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-ice-fcf-fastgraph.png 969w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-ice-fcf-fastgraph-300x182.png 300w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-ice-fcf-fastgraph-768x465.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 969px) 100vw, 969px" /></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs</em></p>
<p>The valuation of P/E and P/FCF being in the low-to-mid-twenties is slightly higher than I&#8217;d prefer, but compared to a lot of alternatives out there, is more than acceptable. The dividend-adjusted PEG ratio is around 2x which is fair, given current and expected discount rates.</p>
<p>If inflation remains low, then equity valuations can remain rather high, so ICE should do well in that environment. If inflation picks up and we enter a true commodity bull cycle, that could put downward pressure on valuations of growth stocks in general, but it should be great for ICE&#8217;s earnings like it was in the 2000s decade.</p>
<p>So, it&#8217;s kind of a win/win stock unless certain tail risks occur, which makes it a nice diversifier with attractive risk-adjusted long-term compounding return potential.</p>
<p><strong>Company Risks</strong></p>
<p>Although exchanges are very wide-moat businesses that are challenging to displace, they do have some risks.</p>
<p><em>Targeted Taxes</em></p>
<p>The past few decades have seen a widening gap between the rich and the working/middle classes, especially in the United States. Those with assets have prospered, while those without assets have languished.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that targeted taxes could be added to trading to pay for stimulus and reduce the structural fiscal budget deficit, which could subsequently impact the exchange company&#8217;s revenue.</p>
<p>To reduce this risk, an investor can diversify into exchanges across multiple jurisdictions (more on that in the ETF below).</p>
<p><em>Tokenization</em></p>
<p>Exchanges that use tokens rather than shares of assets are starting to pop up. For example, SBI Holdings and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group of Japan are partnering to launch the <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Markets/Japan-s-SBI-and-SMFG-to-set-up-digitalized-securities-exchange" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Osaka Digital Exchange</a> in a couple of years, which will compete with the Tokyo Stock Exchange. There has been similar activity in Singapore. From that link:</p>
<blockquote><p>The joint venture also aims to be the first Japanese exchange to handle digital securities using blockchain technology.</p>
<p>The exchange will use a proprietary trading system, an electronic trading venue run by a securities company to allow investors to conduct transactions outside a normal public exchange.</p>
<p>The companies aim to make the exchange more attractive to investors by taking orders outside the TSE&#8217;s trading hours and reducing the tick size, the minimum amount securities can move up or down.</p></blockquote>
<p>Exchange companies can sometimes get ahead of this trend by buying these start-ups. ICE in particular tends to grow and diversify through acquisitions, although sometimes regulators keep them in check so they don&#8217;t get too concentrated.</p>
<p>This is a slow-moving threat but one to keep an eye on. ICE&#8217;s diversified businesses with stocks, futures, mortgages, and other products gives them a lot of resiliency against challengers, but they are not immune to technological disruption.</p>
<p>Overall, ICE is a mix of entrenched and growing businesses, and is actually one of the medium-sized holdings in the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), categorized by ARK as an innovative growing disruptor itself.</p>
<h2>ETF Highlight: Inflation Beneficiaries ETF</h2>
<p>Horizon Kinetics LLC released a new actively-managed ETF early this year that is rather relevant for this report, since it has a ton of exposure to exchanges, for those that are interested in them without holding individual stocks. It&#8217;s not available on M1 Finance at the moment but it can be purchased through other brokers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s called the <a href="https://horizonkinetics.com/products/etf/infl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inflation Beneficiaries ETF (INFL)</a>, and it focuses on companies that are strong in the current environment, but that would also get an extra boost if broad consumer price inflation were to show up.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12067" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-infl-overview.png" alt="INFL Overview" width="751" height="522" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-infl-overview.png 751w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-2-28-infl-overview-300x209.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px" /></p>

<p>Many companies that do well in inflationary periods tend to struggle in disinflationary periods. Commodity producers, for example, tend to be very boom/bust in their performance, and so whatever gains they enjoy from the bull market, they often lose in the bear market, rather than being long-term compounders across multiple cycles.</p>
<p>Horizon&#8217;s ETF focuses on high-margin companies, meaning firms whose revenue is variable, with quite a bit of pricing power that can go up a lot in inflationary or normal environments, but whose expenses are relatively fixed. Any price gains that occur, therefore, mostly fall directly down to the bottom line, and boost it disproportionately well. They can get through disinflationary environments just fine, but then truly shine in inflationary environments.</p>
<p>Horizon Kinetics is interesting because they were one of the first firms to invest in bitcoin within the context of a diversified portfolio on behalf of their clients, several years ago. I spoke with two of the portfolio managers for the INFL ETF earlier this year, along with a couple other folks at the firm, and they&#8217;re certainly quite rigorous with their equity research.</p>
<p>If you look through the <a href="https://horizonkinetics.com/products/etf/infl/#holdings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list of holdings</a>, you&#8217;ll see a lot of exchanges and royalty companies. They have ICE, as well as many of their exchange company equivalents around the world (Germany, Singapore, Australia, etc). Their royalty companies include gold royalties (including FNV, WPM, and SAND) and industrial metal royalties. If commodity prices go up, most of these companies will have a lot of pricing power, while their expenses remain rather controlled.</p>
<p>So, that&#8217;s another way to get exposure to this report&#8217;s subject company, for folks who don&#8217;t like holding individual stocks.</p>
