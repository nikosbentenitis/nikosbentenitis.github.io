<p>This report covers macro conditions, including equity valuations, jobs, inflation, bonds, the dollar, gold, bitcoin, and altcoins. It then updates the various model portfolios.</p>
<p>For the stock analysis portion, the report will take a look at the long-term opportunities and risks of the energy sector.</p>
<p>As a housekeeping note, I just published a longform public research piece on inflation <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, so I recommend checking that out since it will add context to this report.</p>
<h2>Macro View</h2>
<p>US hospitalizations attributable to COVID-19 are currently low and heading lower:</p>

<p>Globally, the situation is more of a mixed bag. India, the recent hot spot, at least seems to finally be nearing a top in daily new case counts:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-india-covid.png" alt="India COVID Cases" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-india-covid.png 700w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-india-covid-300x195.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" width="700" height="455"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Worldometer</a></em></p>
<p>Reported deaths occur with a lag after reported cases, but deaths are also starting to round over in India.</p>
<p>According to official numbers, nearly 250,000 deaths are attributable to COVID-19 in India since the start of the pandemic until now. This is the second-highest in the world after the United States. As a percentage of the population, India has 176 reported deaths per million people, compared to 1,790 per million people for the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Equity Valuations and Sector Rotation</strong></p>
<p>Here’s an update for the US value-vs-growth equity ratio. When the line is going up, value stocks are outperforming growth stocks, and when the line is going down, it means growth stocks are outperforming.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-value-vs-growth.png" alt="Value vs Growth" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-value-vs-growth.png 653w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-value-vs-growth-226x300.png 226w" sizes="(max-width: 653px) 100vw, 653px" width="653" height="868"></p>
<p>This chart is for the US, but the international version lines up very closely with it as well. Sector styles tend to move in tandem across regions, especially when sector rotations happen.</p>
<p>Different markets do have different sector mixes, however. The US market has been more concentrated in tech/growth for a while, and consequently has a growth tilt with higher valuations.</p>
<p>This chart shows the cyclically-adjusted earnings yield of the S&amp;P 500 via the blue line (lower means more expensive), and the forward 10-year inflation-adjusted annual returns of the S&amp;P 500 from those years via the orange bars:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-cape-ratio.png" alt="CAPE Ratio" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-cape-ratio.png 646w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-cape-ratio-300x232.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 646px) 100vw, 646px" width="646" height="500"></p>
<p><em>Data Sources: Robert Shiller, Aswath Damodaran</em></p>
<p>At current valuation levels, long-term real return prospects for the S&amp;P 500 don’t look great. That’s not a great timing tool of course; valuations haven’t looked great for a few years now and still the S&amp;P 500 has gone up. But it’s something to keep in mind and monitor.</p>
<p>Within the index, I still think plenty of stocks are reasonably-priced, although they tend to fall more on the value side than the growth side. I also prefer having a sizable foreign equity allocation where possible, and still like to have a gold hedge in this market.</p>
<p><strong>The Jobs Report</strong></p>
<p>The US April payroll report came in lighter this past Friday than economist expectations.</p>
<p>In fact, it was the biggest negative gap between consensus expectations for the numbers and the actual numbers in over twenty years. The report showed 266,000 in net new jobs created between March and April, compared to the 1 million net new jobs that consensus economist expectations were set for. Ouch.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-payrolls.png" alt="Payrolls" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-payrolls.png 686w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-payrolls-300x197.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px" width="686" height="450"></p>
<p>Economists also expected the official unemployment rate to tick down from 6.0% to 5.8%, but instead it ticked up to 6.1%.</p>
<p>On the news, the dollar had a notable decline for the day, and shorter-duration Treasury yields ticked lower. Basically, the market interpreted it to mean that this will delay any potential hawkish behavior from the Fed, since they are favoring maximizing employment rather than minimizing inflation at this time when it comes to their policy approach.</p>
<p>There has been a divergence between job openings and payrolls recently, meaning that jobs are available but the wages offered are not high enough to attract people back to the workforce. Unemployed Americans are receiving state aid and then an additional $300 in weekly additions from the federal government. This aid offered folks a valuable lifeline during the pandemic and shutdowns, but now is tightening the labor market for low-pay professions, especially including fast food workers. Fast food wages barely pay any better than the combined federal/state unemployment benefits. Plus, a percentage of the population is still concerned about the virus, although over time this effect should diminish.</p>
<p>The federal portion of the unemployment benefits runs out in September, so employers are reluctant to raise wages before then. For example, if they have to offer $15/hr to someone now in order to entice them to work instead of receive unemployment benefits, but think they can hold out and offer only $12/hr when unemployment benefits expire, then they will be reluctant to raise the wages to a necessary level to hire now.</p>
<p>Some of them are instead offering sign-on bonuses, so they don’t lock themselves into permanently higher wages for new workers, but provide a temporary extra incentive up front to start the job now.</p>
<p>The local Chipotle near me has some “online order only” days during each week because they have acute labor shortages, leaving them unable to run the full location on random days.</p>
<p>Other parts of the stimulus bills don’t compete with jobs too much. For example, the three rounds of stimulus checks were handed out to both folks who have jobs and who don’t have jobs (as long as they’re under an upper middle class income level), so there wasn’t an incentive mechanism there to keep people out of the labor force. Whatever folks got from the checks is on top of other income rather than competing with it.</p>
<p>Instead, it’s specifically the extra unemployment benefits that only unemployed people get, that are competing with low-wage jobs and likely contributing to some labor shortages.</p>
<p>So, labor data could continue to be a bit weird for the next several months until September, and it’s something to monitor as we move forward.</p>
<p>US median wages have barely moved at all over the past four decades in inflation-adjusted terms, as automation, offshoring, and other factors put a lot of downward pressure on the power that workers have to earn higher wages. Labor’s share of the US economy (measured in terms of compensation as a percentage of the country’s economic output) diminished gradually from the 1960s to the 2000s, and then dropped more quickly starting in the early 2000s. This happened to some extent to most developed countries, but it was particularly strong for the United States and certain Southern European countries.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the other side of that situation, China’s exports accelerated, as a sizable chunk of the US industrial growth trend was instead shifted to them.</p>
<p>China’s exports:</p>

<p>However, as measured by global trade as a percentage of global GDP, globalization has so far peaked back in 2008. And then with COVID-19 and associated supply chain disruptions since 2020 including for critical things like semiconductors and pharmaceutical components, there has been a renewed recognition that too much offshoring beyond a certain point creates national security risks.</p>

<p>This could very well be the start of a longer-term move up in US wages. They were already showing some upward pressure in 2019, and now post-2020, there is a lot of new money in the system. However, it’s still premature to conclude that until we start seeing some post-September data when unemployment benefits normalize.</p>
<p><strong>Interest Rates, Gold, and the Dollar</strong></p>
<p>Inflation expectations continue to pick up, as we head into reporting periods of the easy-base-effect months (April through June, reported with a lag in May through July).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-inflation-rates.png" alt="Inflation Rates" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-inflation-rates.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-inflation-rates-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="433"></p>
<p>April’s inflation numbers will be reported next week. Due to a combination of low base effects and actual price increases, the number will be over 3% year-over-year, with a good shot at being over 3.5%. The fiscal policy actions, combined with economic re-opening and supply chain issues continue to be a potent cocktail for reflation.</p>
<p>A number of foreign central banks have either raised rates or reigned in their volume of asset purchases, although the Fed is maintaining their current policy approach for now. Some Fed members, particularly those not able to vote for policy in this cycle, are also starting to make noises about tapering the rate of asset purchases at some point.</p>
<p>Eventually, perhaps around the third quarter of this year, the reflation party will run into some headwinds for a period of time, but I’ll monitor things as they move. Starting in September 2021, the extra federal unemployment benefits end, and are unlikely to be extended in their current form.</p>
<p>Gold continues to find support, as inflation-adjusted 10-year Treasury rates have rolled over. This chart shows the gold price in red, and inflation-adjusted 10-year Treasury yields in blue:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-gold-vs-real-rates.png" alt="Gold vs Real Rates" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-gold-vs-real-rates.png 686w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-gold-vs-real-rates-300x197.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px" width="686" height="450"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: St. Louis Fed</em></p>
<p>As I’ve been covering for about 4-6 weeks now, I think there’s a good probability that the low for gold is in after an 8-month correction. Inflation looks to run hot here and I don’t think rates will keep up, which would result in lower real yields if true. We’ll see.</p>
<p>I continue to like gold stocks here as well, at current gold price levels. Back during the early 2000s gold bull run, gold miners had high input costs and did a lot of destructive overpriced acquisitions, which destroyed capital and made them overleveraged with little or no free cash flow generation. Many of the CEOs of that era were replaced during the subsequent 2010s bear market in the industry.</p>
<p>Now, after a lot of reform, we see many gold stocks that focus on generating free cash flow, with a focus on controlling costs and only doing selective acquisitions. Here’s Barrick Gold (GOLD) for example, with the free cash flow version of their F.A.S.T. Graph chart:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-gold-fastgraph.png" alt="GOLD FASTGraph" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-gold-fastgraph.png 961w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-gold-fastgraph-300x182.png 300w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-gold-fastgraph-768x465.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 961px) 100vw, 961px" width="961" height="582"></p>
<p>As far as the dollar index is concerned, I re-iterated in the previous deep dive report that I remain structurally dollar bearish at this time. Friday’s break of support for this recent multi-month counter-rally was a nice confirmation of that. Here’s the 1-year chart and 5-year chart:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-dxy-index.png" alt="Dollar Index" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-dxy-index.png 750w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-dxy-index-239x300.png 239w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" width="750" height="942"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: Trading Economics</em></p>
<p>The next level to watch is the cycle low that the dollar index reached right at the start of January of this year. If it breaks below that, the final support level to watch is the 2018 low. If it breaks below that, things get interesting. For as long as it remains above those levels, the breakdown isn’t quite a big deal yet.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting long-term charts in my view, compares US corporate profits to the dollar index. Whenever the dollar has a strong cycle, the global economy starts to seize up due to tight liquidity, including US corporate profits flattening out, and the past two times it was resolved by a policy mix that resulted in a weaker dollar and a global reflation. My base case, unless evidence mounts to the contrary, is that it’s not different this time for this inverse relationship. My <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/fraying-petrodollar-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">petrodollar article</a> goes into detail on why this dynamic happens.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-profits-vs-dollar.png" sizes="(max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-profits-vs-dollar.png 686w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-profits-vs-dollar-300x197.png 300w" alt="Corporate Profits vs Dollar" width="686" height="450"></p>

<p>The March US trade deficit numbers recently came in at a record size as well, further confirming that the dollar is overvalued on a trade-balance basis. Basically, a lot of things together point towards a dollar-bear cycle and a commodity-bull cycle underway, but it’s something I’ll continue to monitor for contraindicators as we go along.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Note</h2>
<p>Bitcoin has continued what is now a 2.5 month consolidation:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-bitcoin-price.png" alt="Bitcoin Price" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-bitcoin-price.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-bitcoin-price-300x182.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="394"></p>
<p>This is a longer consolidation than at any point in the 2017 bull run. However, some of the corrections in 2017 were deeper on a percentage price decline basis than any of the corrections in 2021.</p>
<p>Philip Swift’s “Pi Cycle Top Indicator” triggered at the recent $64k Bitcoin local top. There are red dotted lines indicating trigger points on the chart that are hard to see, so I made additional annotations via red dots of previous top indicators to make it more clear. The moving averages crossed less decisively than previous tops. You can also follow the link under the chart to see the larger chart and zoom in if you want:</p>

<p>Note that during the 2013 post-halving bull run, there was a first-stage bull run with a Pi Cycle Top, then a 6-month major correction and consolidation, followed by a second-stage bull run with a second Pi Cycle Top. This differed from 2017’s post-halving bull run that was nearly continuous, with corrections shorter than 2 months that only culminated in one big Pi Cycle Top at the end. So far, 2021 is starting to look more like a mix between the two.</p>
<p>Most on-chain indicators show that bitcoin never got as frothy in this cycle as in previous cycles, which remains evidence (but not proof) against this having been the ultimate post-halving cycle top.</p>
<p>Here’s the deviation between market capitalization and cost basis:</p>

<p>The economy and various inflation metrics heating up in the late spring and early summer should, all else being equal, still be constructive for bitcoin’s price action. However, it’s less clear of a trade than it was back in 2020. Altcoins are currently eating into investor demand for bitcoin, and overall risk asset sentiment is very high at the moment. I remain constructive on bitcoin’s price but there is a lot of variance for how it could move for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>The biggest bitcoin news of the past week is that NYDIG is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/05/bitcoin-is-coming-to-hundreds-of-us-banks-says-crypto-firm-nydig-.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partnering with a large number of banks</a> to let customers buy, hold, and sell bitcoin within their existing bank accounts. According to NYDIG, banks are seeing many clients send money over to exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken, and banks naturally want a piece of that action and to retain those funds wherever possible. (My bank probably noticed weekly outflows to <a href="https://www.swanbitcoin.com/alden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swan Bitcoin</a> during 2020). This NYDIG news can also expand the usage of debit cards that earn rewards in bitcoin, and bank dollar accounts that pay interest in bitcoin.</p>
<p>And then within a couple days after that announcement, it <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/104202/bitcoin-firm-nydig-hires-cfo-bridgewater-john-dalby" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was announced</a> that the CFO of Bridgewater, the largest hedge fund in the world, is moving over to become the CFO of NYDIG. This echoes the news of two months ago where it was announced that the CEO of the New York Life Insurance Company (which has $700B in assets under management) was joining NYDIG’s board while remaining the CEO of New York Life. Months before that, it was announced that MassMutual, another larger insurer, bought $100 million in bitcoin, and bought a $5 million equity stake in NYDIG itself.</p>
<p>I’ve spoken with Ross Stevens, the executive chairman of NYDIG, and I can say he’s extremely passionate about bitcoin, and is aiming big with this industry. As we’re seeing by these sorts of news items, NYDIG has positioned itself well as a partner and custodian for banks and insurers to access bitcoin for their clients or portfolios accordingly.</p>
<h2>Ethereum and Altcoin Note</h2>
<p>As strong as Bitcoin’s performance has been this year (up 96% YTD in 2021, after being up 347% in 2020), alternative cryptocurrencies have done even better in terms of percent gains, especially starting about a month ago in April.</p>
<p>This has historically occurred during the heart of bull runs in the industry, as speculation reaches a high level of excitement and retail traders move out on the risk curve to try to find the “next big thing” that will go up a lot from a small starting level.</p>
<p>Ethereum, the other mega-cap cryptocurrency besides bitcoin, had a big price breakout in April that still continues until now. And then smaller tokens along the risk spectrum have done even better.</p>
<p>Caution is warranted at whichever point this bull cycle ends; if we look back into previous bull cycles like 2013 and 2017, the number of coins from those eras that went on to hold their value over the long run is a very tiny percentage. Bitcoin has done well, Ethereum has done well, and only a few others out of the thousands.</p>
<p>I have some concerns about long-term tail risks related to Ethereum (lack of sufficient decentralization and large changes in the protocol planned in the years ahead), but in terms of price performance, whenever Bitcoin does well, Ethereum and other coins at the time historically have a period of time of doing even better. So far, this cycle has been no different. And unlike the other altcoins, Ethereum is the second-largest protocol with a significant network effect.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-ethereum-price.png" alt="Ethereum Price" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-ethereum-price.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-ethereum-price-300x182.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="394"></p>
<p>Unlike my BTC position which is pretty large, I only have a small amount of ETH for DeFi-related gas fees and general testing. I do have a decent amount of stablecoin exposure (USDC and GUSD) earning interest at <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/blockfi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlockFi</a> and AAVE, which for the stablecoin versions I use, run on the Ethereum blockchain as ERC-20 tokens. I’ve been providing occasional coverage this year for those that trade ETH itself:</p>
<blockquote><p>For those that are watching it, a firm Ethereum price break over $1,400 should be pretty bullish for the protocol in the intermediate term, since it clears out overhead resistance. Long term, I don’t have much of an opinion either way about it other than that it’s a higher implementation risk than Bitcoin.</p></blockquote>
<p>-January 31, 2021 report</p>
<blockquote><p>Statistically speaking, Ethereum and other alts could very well outperform bitcoin to the upside during the bull period of the cycle as they often do, but I’d be worried about a lot of digital assets, especially outside of bitcoin itself, on a down leg of the cycle in maybe 2022 or 2023.</p></blockquote>
<p>-February 14, 2021 report</p>
<blockquote><p>I prefer the risk-adjusted return potential of BTC, although some of my readers prefer a broader crypto portfolio so we were due for an ETH update here.&nbsp;Basically, I have a tactically bullish outlook for ETH with a 6-month view along with BTC, but not a ton of conviction on that protocol in general, especially longer-term.</p></blockquote>
<p>-April 11, 2021 report</p>
<p>And when we look out past that on the risk curve, Ethereum Classic has actually done even better than Ethereum this year. It’s up by a crazy percentage:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-classic.png" alt="Ethereum Classic" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-classic.png 834w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-classic-300x137.png 300w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-classic-768x350.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 834px) 100vw, 834px" width="834" height="380"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coindesk</a></em></p>
<p>Back in 2016, Ethereum suffered a major setback when an <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/understanding-dao-hack-journalists" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attacker exploited a bug in smart contracts</a> and took a ton of coins from a large entity that had raised $150 million in investor money. It was a significant minority percentage of total Ethereum coins at the time, numbering in the millions of coins. The attacker argued that it was a fair and legal exploit of a poorly-constructed digital contract after carefully reviewing it for shortcomings, rather than actual theft.</p>
<p>The Ethereum Foundation intervened to roll this attack back by hard-forking the Ethereum blockchain to a new chain. This took the coins back from the attacker to the original owners.</p>
<p>Ethereum Classic is the original chain, the version where the the attack was never rolled back. Ethereum Classic is a much smaller chain with a much weaker developer ecosystem and much weaker network effect. The hard fork that rolled back the attack became the main Ethereum chain in terms of popularity, size, and ongoing development despite being the hard fork itself. Since then, Ethereum continues to hard fork to make changes, but those other forks didn’t cause a community split like the 2016 one did to some extent.</p>
<p>And yet, in this environment of high crypto speculation, the lesser-developed Ethereum Classic chain is outperforming what is considered the main Ethereum chain in percent price gains this year.</p>
<p>Since April, Bitcoin Cash has also been outperforming the main Bitcoin blockchain as well. Bitcoin Cash forked away from Bitcoin back in 2017 and has since underperformed, but is currently enjoying a speculation price spike like many other tokens.</p>
<p>And of course Dogecoin, which was originally created as a joke years ago, but started to get pumped by Elon Musk last year, has even bigger percent gains:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-doge.png" alt="Doge" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-doge.png 812w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-doge-300x136.png 300w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-doge-768x347.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 812px) 100vw, 812px" width="812" height="367"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: Coindesk</em></p>
<p>So far, 2021 has had an inverse relationship between quality and price action for the crypto space. Bitcoin and Ethereum have lagged Ethereum Classic, Dogecoin, and one called Cumrocket in terms of percent price gains. A lot of this is… very bubbly. When Ethereum Classic, Bitcoin Cash, and meme coins are going vertical, it’s a good time to check risk management for the space overall.</p>
<p>I remain focused on a tax-advantaged and risk-adjusted method of holding Bitcoin in my portfolio, rather than actively trading various altcoins.</p>

<p>-Sell 300 shares (a third of the position) of the Uranium Participation Corp (URPTF).</p>
<p>-Buy 20 more shares of Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY).</p>
<p>I originally recommended the Uranium Participation Corp (URPTF) in my October 25, 2020 deep dive report. It has since gained 54%, vs 23% for the S&amp;P 500. It’s a bit less compelling at the moment after this run, although I remain long-term bullish.</p>
<p>When I initially recommended it, it was trading at a 20% discount to NAV, meaning that investors were basically buying a dollar’s worth of uranium for eighty cents. Now, it’s trading at a roughly 20% premium to NAV, meaning that investors are buying a dollar’s worth of uranium for about $1.20. The bull case for uranium is that it is at least 50% undervalued for where it needs to be over the next 5-7 years in order to bring enough uranium to market to keep nuclear reactors online.</p>
<p>The Uranium Participation Corp recently announced a business change where they will be acquired by Sprott, which is a good thing and will expand the asset base. Sprott will issue new shares to buy uranium and add it to the fund whenever the fund trades at a high premium to NAV. This should reduce the premium, but on the other side of the coin, is bullish for the spot price since it will accelerate the global depletion of secondary supplies, and tighten the market.</p>
<p>At a 20% premium, I think investors should be a bit cautious about current levels. I plan to take some profits here while maintaining a position, as I continue to view the long-term uranium thesis as being attractive from a risk/reward standpoint, with the only issue here being the premium.</p>
<p><strong>Other Holdings</strong></p>
<p>-Buy more Lukoil (LUKOY).</p>

<p>It has been several months since I last covered energy (oil and gas) stocks, and they are worth reviewing at this time in my opinion, especially from a longer-term perspective.</p>
<p>I’ll touch on some specific names like Exxon Mobil (XOM), Lukoil (LUKOY), and Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD) in this report, but the broad topic is about the sector as a whole. Energy stocks had a nice bounce in recent months but overall, many large pools of capital are structurally underweight the sector.</p>
<p>Here’s the iShares Global Energy ETF (IXC), showing the sector’s dismal performance during the past fifteen years. The purple line is the price and the orange line adjusts it to include reinvested dividends:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-ixc-performance.png" alt="IXC Performance" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-ixc-performance.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-ixc-performance-300x192.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="416"></p>
<p>From 2001 to 2008, that ETF and ones like it were big outperformers, but from 2008 onward they deeply underperformed. The sector had negative total returns since 2008, including reinvested dividends.</p>
<p>The industry was disrupted by a number of events, creating a perfect storm for producers. The global financial crisis hit in 2008, the European sovereign debt crisis hit in 2011, North American shale added a lot of new supply to the market from 2010 to 2015, and a strong dollar suppressed commodity prices and the global growth rate (and thus oil demand) from 2015 through 2019. The pandemic temporarily obliterated oil demand in 2020, culminating in what was probably the ultimate bottom for the sector in this cycle when WTI crude futures went into negative pricing in April 2020 due to oversupply.</p>
<p>As we look out longer, many pools of capital are avoiding the sector due to ESG mandates, and many investors are concerned that oil and gas will face secular stagnation as renewable energy sources displace them.</p>
<p><strong>The Long-Term Oil Cycle</strong></p>
<p>Here’s a chart with 150 years of data that shows the rolling 5-year cumulative percent price change for crude oil:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-oil-longterm.png" alt="Oil Longterm" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-oil-longterm.png 642w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-oil-longterm-294x300.png 294w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" width="642" height="655"></p>
<p>The period of time over the past several years was historically about as bad as it gets for the oil market within the past century, comparable to the mid-1980s and mid-1930s.</p>
<p>If we look at bellwethers in the industry, Exxon Mobil (XOM) for example never previously had a drawdown as bad as it had from 2014 to 2020, in five decades of data:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-xom-drawdown.png" alt="XOM Drawdown" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-xom-drawdown.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-xom-drawdown-300x192.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="416"></p>
<p>Ironically but not surprisingly, it has historically been a good idea to buy Exxon Mobil and other oil stocks whenever the energy outlook looks terrible. This next chart shows Exxon’s share price compared to the EIA’s assessment of OPEC spare production capacity.</p>
<p>Whenever there is a ton of spare capacity (too much oil supply vs weak demand), that’s been the time to buy. Even the one “early” signal still greatly outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over the next several years.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-xom-vs-opec-spare-capacity.png" alt="XOM vs OPEC Spare Capacity" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-xom-vs-opec-spare-capacity.png 655w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-xom-vs-opec-spare-capacity-243x300.png 243w" sizes="(max-width: 655px) 100vw, 655px" width="655" height="807"></p>

<p>Future supply may not be so abundant at current prices, though. Ever since energy prices collapsed in 2014 due to structural shale-driven oversupply and dollar strengthening conditions, global oil capex has diminished significantly:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-oil-capex.png" alt="Oil Capex" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-oil-capex.png 700w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-oil-capex-300x156.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" width="700" height="365"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: <a href="https://www.rystadenergy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rystad Energy</a></em></p>
<p>As Rick Rule of Sprott often says about the natural resources sector, bear markets are the authors of bull markets, and bull markets are the authors of bear markets. Because prices have been low, there has been less investment to bring new supply to market. The sector gradually started to recover, but then got knocked down again by the events of 2020.</p>
<p>In 2019, global oil demand reached just over 100 million barrels per day. After falling very fast in 2020, demand has since recovered to about 95 million barrels per day, with various forecasts that generally point to late 2021 or sometime in 2022 that it’ll reach previous peak demand levels.</p>
<p>China and India still present significant oil demand potential. They have a lot of consumption growth that is offsetting the stagnant levels of energy consumption in developed markets. Here’s China’s pre-pandemic oil consumption per year:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-china-oil-consumption.png" alt="China Oil Consumption" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-china-oil-consumption.png 627w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-china-oil-consumption-300x139.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 627px) 100vw, 627px" width="627" height="290"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: <a href="https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/china/oil-consumption" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CEIC</a></em></p>
<p>To put things into perspective, the United States consumes more than 3x as much oil per capita as Thailand, and Thailand consumes more than 2x as much oil per capita as China. If China ever reaches the point where it consumes as much oil per capita as Thailand does now, that change alone would add 15 million barrels of daily demand.</p>
<p>India consumes a little over a third as much oil per capita as China, which totals about 5 million barrels per day. If they ever reach China’s current consumption levels (which, again, are only half as much as Thailand and one sixth as much as the US), that would add nearly 10 million barrels to daily global demand.</p>
<p>And then there’s Indonesia, Nigeria, and other large population countries with low per capita demand that have a lot of upward demand potential as well.</p>
<p>But then offsetting that growth, Europe and Japan are gradually rolling over in oil demand from their historical peak levels, and the United States is likely next. However, those countries that are shrinking their oil demand for a while now, are generally increasing their natural gas demand or holding it steady. So, the overall oil and gas demand is pretty stable in developed countries and still rising in emerging countries.</p>
<p>Plus, one of the main ways that developed markets were able to reduce their domestic oil consumption was by exporting parts of their energy-intensive manufacturing supply chains to China and other emerging markets. A portion of China’s fossil fuel consumption “belongs” to developed markets in that sense, in terms of final consumption. The same is true for other export nations. It’s hard for a country to actually reduce its consumption, when all the moving parts are considered including the parts they exported out of their borders but still benefit from.</p>
<p><strong>The Global Energy Mix</strong></p>
<p>The general consensus is that global oil demand will peak in the 2020s or 2030s at roughly the current level, and then gradually or quickly roll over as the world shifts towards renewable energy.</p>
<p>Governments have various targets for carbon emissions, and so most oil majors have slides like this in their presentation decks that show the various possible scenarios regarding how quickly the world will move away from oil. Even with the most aggressive scenario of oil demand destruction, capex will be needed to bring new supply to market to offset current decline rates.</p>

<p>What’s interesting is that if this big oil reduction target is achieved, it would be a global first. Historically, whenever humanity finds a new energy source, it doesn’t replace the previous one, but instead <em>adds</em> to&nbsp;it:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-energy-mix.png" alt="Global Energy Mix" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-energy-mix.png 678w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-energy-mix-300x235.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" width="678" height="530"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/energy-mix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our World in Data</a></em></p>
<p>Humanity burned biomass for energy, and then we added coal but didn’t stop burning biomass. Then we added oil, but coal stayed around as well, especially in emerging markets. India and China are still growing their coal usage each year. Then we added natural gas, but still use oil. Then we added nuclear power and hydroelectric, but we’re also still growing our natural gas usage as well. Hydroelectric, solar, and wind energy have been additive onto that as well.</p>
<p>In addition, each new primary energy source was more energy dense than the previous one, until recently. Fossil fuels are concentrated ancient biomass. As you go from wood to coal to oil to nuclear, you move up the spectrum of energy density. Hydroelectric power is also extremely energy dense when the right type of river is present.</p>
<p>Solar and wind, however, are less dense energy sources. If humanity successfully transitions to getting half or more of its energy from wind and solar, it would not only be a first in terms of displacing previous energy sources rather than adding to them, but would also be a first at successful moving the world to a less dense primary energy source.</p>
<p>Plus, oil and gas derivatives are used for all sorts of materials, including clothing, plastic, wrappers around wires, wind turbine blades, and all sorts of other things we don’t think about. Those use-cases would need to be replaced as well, with plant-based chemicals instead.</p>
<p>What I’m saying is that there’s implementation risk here in terms of global oil demand being able to roll over and fall off a cliff. I support renewable energy usage and carbon capture technologies. But I’m also watching what happens in the market.</p>
<p>Throughout the 2010s decade, tons of pensions and other funds invested into shale oil financing, and destroyed a lot of their capital as oil drillers kept focusing on growth rather than profitability and never became reliably free cash flow positive.</p>
<p>More recently, in addition to that history of losses, the proliferation of ESG mandates to address CO2 levels and other environmental concerns made many large pools of capital decide to stop investing in oil.</p>

<p>So with less external investment demand, oil producers are more focused on being free cash flow positive and self-sufficiently reinvesting into their businesses, rather than running on perpetual free cash flow destruction and relying on external capital to keep them going to grow as fast as possible.</p>
<p>Kind of like how the gold industry has recently shifted towards focusing on free cash flow generation more-so than fast growth, I think the oil market is headed in that direction too, out of necessity.</p>
<p>So, in order to meet even aggressive disruption scenarios with lower oil usage, more production has to come online to offset natural decline rates from existing wells, and this reinvesting will likely have more of a profit mandate in this cycle. Oil prices likely need to be at a level that justifies new capex and production.</p>
<p>In other words, I think there is a good probability that the 2008 oil price spike was not the last one that will ever occur. This current period of low prices and low capex has a decent shot of causing supply constraints and the next upswing in price levels as we head deeper into this decade.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-oil-longterm.png" alt="Oil Longterm" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-oil-longterm.png 642w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-oil-longterm-294x300.png 294w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" width="642" height="655"></p>
<p>In the meantime, I like to focus on oil producers and transporters that are profitable at current oil price levels. Ones with low production costs and strong balance sheets. If oil plods along sideways or mildly up, and producers keep paying big dividends, then they have the potential to outperform the highly-valued S&amp;P 500.</p>
<p><strong>Lukoil Update</strong></p>
<p>Although I hold a few energy producers, Lukoil has been my preferred energy play for a while. I can’t hold it in my M1 Finance portfolios because it trades over the counter, but I have a core position for that stock in the No Limits portfolio and my Fidelity/Schwab accounts. I last covered Lukoil in detail in my January 3, 2021 deep dive report.</p>
<p>Lukoil is Russia’s second largest oil producer. They are not state-owned, they have a westernized business model, they have huge insider ownership, and they have outperformed all other oil and gas majors globally during the past 20-year, 10-year, 5-year, and 3-year periods.</p>
<p>Unlike many other oil majors, they haven’t done capital-destructive acquisitions at the top of a business cycle, or other things like that. They just produce oil and gas throughout various places in Eurasia at low production costs, along with refining and distribution businesses, and have the longest reserve life compared to other oil and gas majors at 20 years for current production levels.</p>
<p>In addition, their capital structure is great. As of the most recent filings, Lukoil had $3 billion in net debt (long-term debt minus cash-equivalents) compared to Exxon Mobil with about $60 billion in net debt. As a larger company, Exxon Mobile has about 3x as much revenue and 2x as much net income as Lukoil in a good year. So, Lukoil has much less net debt relative to ongoing revenue, cash flow, net income, etc.</p>
<p>Here is the debt-to-equity ratio of some of the top oil majors:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-oil-majors-debt-equity.png" alt="Oil Major Debt to Equity" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-oil-majors-debt-equity.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-oil-majors-debt-equity-300x216.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="467"></p>
<p>And here’s the EV/EBITDA ratio for oil majors. EBITDA generally collapses during oil bear markets, so EV/EBITDA temporarily goes up (and that’s the time to buy). However, some of the majors trade at consistently lower valuations than others:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-oil-majors-ev-ebitda-ratio.png" alt="Oil Majors EV to EBITDA" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-oil-majors-ev-ebitda-ratio.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-oil-majors-ev-ebitda-ratio-300x216.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="467"></p>
<p>The only one that has both low debt relative to equity and a low EV/EBITDA ratio compared to the others, is Lukoil. But it’s in Russia, and for some investors that is a deal-breaker.</p>
<p>Lukoil’s low debt and low enterprise value relative to EBITDA, along with long reserve life, allows it to shovel all of the free cash flow it generates into dividends for shareholders. And as mentioned, it’s very well-run.</p>
<p>Here’s Exxon’s F.A.S.T. Graph, using free cash flow as the baseline:</p>

<p><strong>Enterprise Products Partners Update</strong></p>
<p>In addition to producers, I like some oil, gas, and petrochemical transporters at current price levels.</p>
<p>Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) has been one of my favorites. They transport oil, gas, natural gas liquids, and petrochemicals, including for exporting to emerging markets.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-epd-fastgraph.png" alt="EPD FASTGraph" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-epd-fastgraph.png 973w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-epd-fastgraph-300x178.png 300w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-epd-fastgraph-768x455.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 973px) 100vw, 973px" width="973" height="577"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs</em></p>
<p>From the mid-1990s to the mid-2010s, pipeline infrastructure grew like wildfire across North America, and then slowed ever since 2015 when oil prices fell due to structural shale oil oversupply.</p>
<p>Pipeline businesses historically haven’t generated much free cashflow in official terms during that rapid expansion phase. A lot of their cash flows are offset by deprecation for tax purposes, and they kept raising capital and reinvesting it into more pipelines while paying distributions which made sense in that environment.</p>
<p>After 2015 with low oil prices and less growth, however, many pipelines transitioned towards being self-sufficient rather than relying on external capital, meaning that they grow more slowly, at lower valuations, with lower distributions and yet still-high distribution yields due to those lower valuations, and reinvest some of their capital into growth and sustainment projects as needed.</p>
<p>Pipelines that were less-indebted and better-managed navigated that transition more gracefully than ones that had too much debt, blew up, and cut distributions to preserve capital.</p>
<p>And so we see with EPD, historically one of the best-of-breed pipeline businesses that handled the transition well (without having to cut their distribution), they are becoming more consistently free cash flow positive. Here’s the free cash flow version of its F.A.S.T. Graph:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-epd-fastgraph-fcf.png" alt="EPD FASTGraph FCF" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-epd-fastgraph-fcf.png 967w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-epd-fastgraph-fcf-300x181.png 300w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-epd-fastgraph-fcf-768x463.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 967px) 100vw, 967px" width="967" height="583"></p>
<p>Likewise, if we look at a more extreme example of Energy Transfer (ET), which did experience a blow-up and distribution cut, they are now entering their first period of generating free cash flow:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-et-fastgraph-fcf.png" alt="ET FASTGraph FCF" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-et-fastgraph-fcf.png 959w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-et-fastgraph-fcf-300x182.png 300w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-9-et-fastgraph-fcf-768x467.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 959px) 100vw, 959px" width="959" height="583"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs</em></p>
<p>In other words, across the energy sector, we are seeing a shift towards self-sufficiency and free cash flow generation, similar to what has happened in the gold mining industry. Oil majors were already self-sufficient before, but now we are seeing it among transporters and smaller producers, which historically never focused much on free cash flow.</p>
<p><strong>Energy Sector Risks</strong></p>
<p>The energy sector has a lot of risks, which is why it is so cheap and out of favor. There are three categories of risk in particular to focus on, with one of those risks being cyclical and the other two being more structural.</p>
<p><em>Global Growth Rates</em></p>
<p>The cyclical risk with oil and gas stocks is that with such a fine balance between supply and demand, any downturn in the global economic growth rate can reduce oil and gas consumption, and thus reduce prices for a period of time.</p>
<p>Investors should make sure they understand the time horizon associated with their oil and gas investments.</p>
<p><em>New Technology</em></p>
<p>The energy sector of course depends on oil/gas prices and oil/gas volumes remaining robust. Earlier in this report I discussed the challenges of renewable energy sources quickly displacing oil and gas. However, we need to monitor the possibility of new technologies accelerating the shift faster than expected.</p>
<p>For example, if new types of solar cells are invented that are big game-changers, or if ultra-deep geothermal energy becomes economical in places that aren’t normally associated with geothermal energy availability, it could eat into oil and gas market share a decade earlier than whatever the base case is.</p>
<p>This risk of rapid technological growth above expectations can be mitigated by focusing on the oil and gas companies with low production costs and strong balance sheets. It can also be mitigated by holding a broad commodity basket, since many commodities including silver, copper, aluminum, and uranium are important for various alternative forms of energy besides oil and gas. Plus, some of the oil and gas majors, like Total (TOT) are gradually adding renewable energy divisions to their portfolio of operations.</p>
<p><em>Taxes and Jurisdictional Risk</em></p>
<p>Countries could choose to raise taxes on their oil and gas sector, or on all companies in their borders. For example, Russia increased taxes on oil companies in 2020, and the Biden Administration is seeking a moderate sector-wide US corporate tax increase.</p>
<p>I like to diversify my oil and gas exposure to companies across the United States, Canada, Europe, and Russia. This reduces jurisdictional risk.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>We’re in the heart of a strong commodity market, and the April CPI report (coming out next week) and the May CPI report (coming out in June) will have high year-over-year prints due to the combination of fiscal stimulus, supply chain issues, and low base effects from last year.</p>
<p>Some commodities like lumber are going parabolic in terms of price action, and are concerning for a highly-probable snap-back at some point. Other ones, like oil and gas, have heated up but still lag the broader basket of them.</p>
<p>Investors should make sure they understand the timeframes associated with their investments. I expect a longer-term positive environment for commodities, but there will be pullbacks along the way, and localized areas of excess.</p>
