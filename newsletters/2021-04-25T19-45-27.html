      <br/><strong>Our Most Popular Books</strong>
      <br/>
      Through this list, I've been able to see which books people love and not surprisingly they are the most popular books in the store. You'll love: <a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=e6ab036ecf&amp;e=cba86b9b7a" target="_blank"><em>Empire of the Summer Moon</em></a> (I believe we have some signed copies) by SC Gwynne. <a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=4937878409&amp;e=cba86b9b7a" target="_blank"><em>The Tiger: A True Story of Vengeance and Survival</em></a> is far and away the best narrative nonfiction book ever. I love Susan Orlean and <em><a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=366514d244&amp;e=cba86b9b7a" target="_blank">The Library Book</a></em> is incredible. Emily Wilson's translation of <em><a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=34424e99d0&amp;e=cba86b9b7a" target="_blank">The Odyssey</a></em> is legit one of our ten best sellers (I love that a 3000-year-old poem is still selling in print form...). <a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=8f67629603&amp;e=cba86b9b7a" target="_blank"><em>The Scarecrow</em></a> is one of the sweetest children's books ever, and most people have never heard of it, so it sells well.

There're a bunch more of course, but I know you'll like those and if you want to support the store, buy from the links above. Or get them anywhere you like to get books!<br/>

      <br/>
      I first read Meditations more than fifteen years ago. I'm a champion of <a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=39e494cf22&amp;e=cba86b9b7a" target="_blank">the Gregory Hays translation</a> but it was a treat (and an eye-opening experience) to read <a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=715c4cfe28&amp;e=cba86b9b7a" target="_blank">this new annotated edition by Robin Waterfield</a>. Marcus, like Heraclitus, believed we never step in the same river twice. Reading a new translation of a book you've read (or love) is a great way to see the same ideas from a new angle...or find new ideas you missed on the previous go-arounds. The annotations (presented as footnotes) here also provide great context. If you haven't read Marcus Aurelius or if you have...you should read this book and then read it again (<a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=ee4f97c9c0&amp;e=cba86b9b7a" target="_blank">here are some lessons from me having read Meditations more than 100 times</a>). <br/>

      <br/>
      I'm not sure I'd be a writer without Steven Pressfield. His new book <a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=c354b660bd&amp;e=cba86b9b7a" target="_blank"><em>A Man At Arms</em></a> is up there with his best book <a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=3a9cf67a83&amp;e=cba86b9b7a" target="_blank"><em>Gates of Fire</em></a> and as it happens, <a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=e370ef2cc8&amp;e=cba86b9b7a" target="_blank"><em>The War of Art</em></a> is one of our most popular books <a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=83a16198f8&amp;e=cba86b9b7a" target="_blank">in our bookstore</a>. <a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=618bd1e178&amp;e=cba86b9b7a" target="_blank">I actually interviewed Steven at The Painted Porch</a> a few weeks before the pandemic, so you can see what the 'before' of the space looked like. Anyway, this new book is great and a must read. Here's my blurb of the book: "An incredible book that I devoured in one sitting. The master behind Gates of Fire does it again!"<br/>
       <br/><strong><em><a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=7b48fd687e&amp;e=cba86b9b7a" target="_blank">Days of Grace: A Memoir</a> </em>by Arthur Ashe and Arnold Rampersad</strong>
      <br/>
      I wrotze about Arthur Ashe in <em><a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=50eba72388&amp;e=cba86b9b7a" target="_blank">The Obstacle is the Way</a></em> (<a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=6a33f698bf&amp;e=cba86b9b7a" target="_blank"><em>Levels of the Game</em></a> is an amazing book). I picked up <a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=8777470d73&amp;e=cba86b9b7a" target="_blank"><em>Days of Grace</em></a> on the recommendation of Arthur Brooks (<a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=c9af693f87&amp;e=cba86b9b7a" target="_blank">our interview here</a>) and I was very moved by it. Also surprised at how relevant it turned out to be: An athlete struggling with his desire to just play sports and the pull of social justice. The tricky politics of race. And then, most tragically, a merciless epidemic that took Ashe's life—but that he faced with courage and selflessness. Even Dr. Fauci makes a brief appearance. The more things change...the more they stay the same. The letter Ashe writes to his daughter as he lay dying is a must, must read for parents.<br/>
