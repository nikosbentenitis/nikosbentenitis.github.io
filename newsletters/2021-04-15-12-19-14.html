<p>This is a brief lunchtime update between normal reports to inform readers about notable asset allocation changes.</p>
<p>I mentioned in <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/premium-2020-6-7/">Sunday’s report</a> that I am planning to potentially reduce equity exposure by 3-5% this week.</p>
<p>This morning in the newsletter model portfolio, I sold the 5% stake in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) and bought a 5% stake in the iShares 1-3 Year Treasury ETF (SHY). This was updated in real time in the Google Drive in the <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/members/">members area</a>, but I’m also sending out this notice since it involves a top-level (albeit not huge) asset allocation shift.</p>
<p>I have no strong opinion about short-term moves but after such a strong rally, I prefer to take a few chips off the table and play a little defense here.</p>
<p>The chart I would draw your attention to in particular is the put/call ratio, which hit a low yesterday that hasn’t been seen in over ten years. Here’s a snapshot:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-6-9-put-call-ratio.png" alt="Put Call Ratio" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-6-9-put-call-ratio.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-6-9-put-call-ratio-300x192.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="416"></p>
<p>This means that investors are buying a very large number of call options (bullish and speculative) relative to put options (bearish or hedging), which has historically been a contrarian signal, meaning the ratio tends to be low near local market peaks and tends to spike up to high levels during local market bottoms. In other words, when the market is high and doing great, people get more speculative and don’t buy hedges as much. When the market has already fallen a lot, that is when a lot of people start hedging.</p>
<p>The market has been in a speculative bullish frenzy in the past two weeks, with call option volumes at record levels among small retail investors.</p>
<p>Even many bankrupt companies have made big gains in the past two weeks, meaning that even though the equity is very likely to go to zero when the company restructures (and even their bonds are trading for pennies on the dollar due to anticipated defaults), traders have nonetheless speculated on higher stock prices and pushed those prices up.</p>
<p>An important question that is difficult to answer is how much has the market already factored this in. By now, it is a well-known fact that there is a retail investor buying frenzy, and I see many investment professionals citing the put/call ratio, or extremely high Nasdaq trading volumes, and looking for a correction. If too many people are looking for a correction, they have a tendency to push up further first.</p>
<p>After yesterday’s big gain in the markets, today is a down day in the markets, particularly for higher-risk equities that have been bid up recently, so maybe we’ll get a bounce tomorrow, or not. But at these levels, I’m performing slight risk reduction.</p>
