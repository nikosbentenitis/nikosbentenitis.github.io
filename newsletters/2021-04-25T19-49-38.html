<p>This report covers macro conditions, inflation, bonds, the dollar, gold, and bitcoin. It then updates the various model portfolios.</p>
<p>For the stock analysis portion, the report will take a look at two healthcare companies. With a lot of euphoria in risk assets lately, defensive healthcare companies have been laggards, but from a long-term perspective, many of them look interesting here.</p>
<p>As a housekeeping note, I just published a <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/market-capitalization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public article about market capitalization and rolling bubbles</a>.</p>
<h2>Macro View</h2>
<p>The virus continues to move in different parts of its cycle around the world.</p>
<p>Here is the United States daily death rate:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-us-covid-deaths.png" alt="US COVID-19 Deaths" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-us-covid-deaths.png 700w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-us-covid-deaths-300x189.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" width="700" height="441"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Worldometer</a></em></p>
<p>And here is India’s daily death rate:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-india-covid-deaths.png" alt="India COVID-19 Deaths" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-india-covid-deaths.png 700w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-india-covid-deaths-300x189.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" width="700" height="441"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: Worldometer</em></p>
<p>In most places, the death rate is pretty low now. By the second half of 2020, the death rate was already pretty low once nursing homes and other vulnerable areas were better-protected and medical interventions were optimized, and here in 2021 in many (but not all) countries, vulnerable members of society that want the vaccine have generally had access to it.</p>
<p>There have been over a billion vaccines administered globally. When counting the fact that most of them require two doses, hundreds of millions of people (rather than a billion) have been vaccinated. Most governments made the option available to the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions first, which got the most vulnerable members vaccinated.</p>
<p>Even in India, where the virus is having a big wave and deaths are going up a lot, it’s still lower than the US’s peak number of daily deaths, although at this rate it looks like it could unfortunately surpass it in absolute daily numbers. Considering that India has more than 4x the population of the United States, India would need to reach a staggering 16,000 daily death count in order to have as high of a daily death rate percentage as the US reached at its peak, if the data are anywhere near accurate.</p>
<p>India’s fairly young population offers some degree of protection on a percentage basis, even though the absolute death count is huge. In that country, only 8% of the population has been vaccinated, although like other places there is an emphasis towards more vulnerable members of society.</p>
<p>The big risk for India and elsewhere would be virus mutations that ignore the immune defenses that were granted from past infections or vaccinations.</p>
<p>Plus, this is a period where absolute numbers and percentage numbers can differ a lot, which fuels political disagreements on what policies to pursue. In the United States, for example, both of these statements are true:</p>
<p>“According to official numbers, a whopping 586,000 US residents have died from the virus, which is more than the number of US soldiers who died in World War II.”</p>
<p>“According to official numbers, only 0.18% of the US population has died from the virus, with mortality concentrating in segments of the population with pre-existing conditions or advanced age.”</p>
<p>Numbers of that sort can be used by various political groups for or against different measures regarding the virus. As I’ve pointed out throughout the past year, the biggest “hard stop” in terms of government intervention tends to be when local hospitals get close to capacity, although that has been relatively rare since the second half of 2020.</p>
<p>While many areas are relaxing restrictions and opening up, others continued to shut down for containment. Ontario last week launched a strict lockdown to curb the virus, and Canada temporarily banned flights from India recently. A few days ago, Japan announced its third state of emergency involving partial lockdowns related to the virus.</p>
<p>Air travel will probably be one of the last economic areas to fully recover. US air travel is less than two-thirds recovered at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>Tax Proposals</strong></p>
<p>The Biden Administration has proposed raising the headline US corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%. More broadly, there is some support between policymakers in various countries to partially unify corporate tax rates, to make it tougher for corporations to flee to tax-haven jurisdictions.</p>
<p>More recently, the Biden Administration announced a proposal to raise long-term capital gains tax rates from 20% to over 40%, for folks making more than a million dollars per year. The stock market briefly sold off in the minutes surrounding this announcement, but popped back up the next day. This announcement also coincided with a round of selling in crypto markets.</p>
<p>According to data collected by the Federal Reserve, 53% of US equities are owned by the top 1% of the population, which is the group that would face these higher capital gains tax rates.</p>
<p>The probability of getting these proposals through the tightly-divided Senate is low. The Biden Administration would need all 50 Democrat-caucus votes to get them through, but a handful of centrist Democrat senators are not on board with this. There may be some tax increases over the next two years, but probably not at this scale. When the next midterm elections occur, we’ll need to re-assess those probabilities based on the outcome.</p>
<p>Overall, this is certainly something to monitor. The effective US corporate tax rate (which is generally lower than the headline rate) has been on a downward trajectory for the duration of the post-WWII era, which has served as a structural tailwind for stock prices. The red line below is the effective federal tax rate, and the blue line below is the total effective federal and state rate:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-corporate-taxes.png" alt="Corporate Taxes" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-corporate-taxes.png 686w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-corporate-taxes-300x197.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px" width="686" height="450"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: St. Louis Fed</em></p>
<p>If these lines start going structurally upward (they can’t go much lower, after all) then that would create a headwind for the stock market. At the very least, if they stop going down, and bounce upward and sideways, it simply removes the long-term tailwind.</p>
<p><strong>The US Business Cycle Heatmap</strong></p>
<p>If we take a broad view of the US economy and break it down part by part, we see some divergences. The economic bottom was in Q2 2020, but from there, some areas have bounced back more than others. Retail sales have been the strong leader, capital spending has also been strong, while exports and payrolls (aka jobs) have been weak areas.</p>
<p>Here is my updated heatmap of various economic indicators for the U.S. economy over the past five years, measured in year-over-year percent change terms. This lets us see a broad spectrum of the economy rather than cherry pick good or bad data points to fit a narrative:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-heatmap.png" alt="Economic Heatmap" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-heatmap.png 687w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-heatmap-300x267.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 687px) 100vw, 687px" width="687" height="612"></p>
<p>The chart starts from the bottom and goes up over five years, and each column represents one of the economic indicators.</p>
<p>For most of the chart, I use a green/yellow/red color spectrum. Green indicates solid growth, yellow indicates medium, and orange/red indicate slow growth or contraction, relative to the rest of the 5-year period for that indicator. In other words, green is good and red is bad.</p>
<p>For inflation CPI, there is a separate blue/white/red color scale, because high or low inflation is not necessarily “good” or “bad” in the same way as the rest of the heat map. Red indicates higher price inflation, white indicates medium, and blue is lower price inflation, relative to the 5-year period. Economic slowdowns tend to be dis-inflationary while economic booms tend to be pro-inflationary, but there are also some business cycles that slow down with high inflation, and thus become “stagflationary”. So, inflation gets its own color scheme.</p>

<p><strong>Interest Rates, Gold, and the Dollar</strong></p>
<p>Inflation is currently running a bit hot, partially due to easy year-over-year comparisons from the same period in 2020, while 10-year Treasury rates have corrected down slightly:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-inflation-and-rates.png" alt="Inflation and Rates" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-inflation-and-rates.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-inflation-and-rates-300x192.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="416"></p>
<p>We’re likely going to get official CPI prints of over 3% in April and/or May (reported in May and June), so we’ll see how Treasury rates respond or if they’ll look forward, expecting it to be completely transient.</p>
<p>So far, this divergence of higher inflation and lower rates has resulted in a pullback in real yields here in April, which all else being equal is good for gold. This chart shows the gold price in red and inflation-adjusted (aka real) 10-Year Treasury yields in blue:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-gold-vs-real-yields.png" alt="Gold vs Real Rates" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-gold-vs-real-yields.png 686w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-gold-vs-real-yields-300x197.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px" width="686" height="450"></p>
<p>In my March 28th deep dive report, I covered two gold royalty companies that were showing signs of having bottomed along with gold. And then in my April 11th report, I stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>My base case is that the dollar index is rolling over and gold is bottoming, although it remains only mild conviction until we see more follow-through. It’s a working hypothesis for now.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, far, gold bottomed in early March, and has continued upward from the March 28th and April 11th reports. In addition, the dollar index (which compares the dollar to major advanced peers, and had been going up since early January 2021) topped out in early April 2021 and has been on a downtrend, including a continued decline since April 11th.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-dollar-index.png" alt="Dollar Index" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-dollar-index.png 746w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-dollar-index-300x188.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 746px) 100vw, 746px" width="746" height="468"></p>
<p>I continue to monitor these trends to see if the follow-through continues, or if these moves were just ephemeral fake-outs.</p>
<p>Gold and the dollar index only have a partial relationship; they can do well together but a weaker dollar generally is helpful for higher gold prices in dollar terms. Gold has a much stronger inverse correlation with inflation-adjusted interest rates than it does with the dollar index.</p>
<p>The performance of emerging markets indices, however, has a closer inverse relationship to the strength of the dollar.</p>
<h2>Equity and Currency Rotations</h2>
<p>Although I emphasize individual stocks rather than factors, I continue to monitor some factor and regional ratios to see if major rotations are occurring or not.</p>
<p>These next charts (long-term and 3-year versions) show the Russell 1000 value index divided by the Russell 1000 growth index. When the line is going up, it means value stocks in aggregate are outperforming. When it’s going down, it means growth stocks are outperforming:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-growth-value.png" alt="Growth vs Value" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-growth-value.png 656w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-growth-value-221x300.png 221w" sizes="(max-width: 656px) 100vw, 656px" width="656" height="890"></p>
<p>My base case for a while now has been that a growth-to-value rotation is underway.</p>
<p>Regional rotations are less clear. This chart shows the S&amp;P 500 divided by the MSCI Emerging Markets index:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-spx-em.png" alt="SPX vs Emerging Markets" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-spx-em.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-spx-em-300x193.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="418"></p>
<p>This ratio looks like it may be topping, but it’s not yet very decisive. There was a fake-rotation back in 2017 that ended up reverting back to the S&amp;P 500 outperforming again into 2020. There were fewer fundamental catalysts back then to expect a rotation than there are now.</p>
<p>This S&amp;P 500 vs emerging markets ratio is tightly correlated to the dollar index, which compares the dollar to a basket of foreign currencies.</p>
<p>Here’s an ultralong-term quarterly technical chart of the dollar index, with some green circles around notable points of interest. If you look back above and compare the S&amp;P 500 to emerging markets ratio, you can see how it overlays with the latter half of this chart:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-dxy-longterm.png" alt="DXY Longterm" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-dxy-longterm.png 700w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-dxy-longterm-300x223.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" width="700" height="521"></p>
<p>My base case, unless fundamental or technical evidence mounts to the contrary, continues to be that we’re in a structural dollar bear market, with 3-5 years more to go in it.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, comparisons of purchasing power parity and trade imbalances also support the notion that the dollar is overvalued, and the relatively aggressive fiscal policy of the United States compared to other nations has been presenting a catalyst for downward pressure.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-big-mac-index.png" alt="Big Mac Index" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-big-mac-index.png 654w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-big-mac-index-246x300.png 246w" sizes="(max-width: 654px) 100vw, 654px" width="654" height="796"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: <a href="https://www.economist.com/big-mac-index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Economist</a></em></p>
<p>Plus, whenever the dollar is in one of its strong cycles, US corporate profits (green line below) go flat. This has historically resolved with the dollar going down and corporate profits breaking out of that consolidation:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-profits-vs-dollar.png" alt="Corporate Profits vs Dollar" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-profits-vs-dollar.png 686w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-profits-vs-dollar-300x197.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px" width="686" height="450"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: St. Louis Fed</em></p>
<p>However, we can’t always assume history will repeat. I’ll continue to monitor these economic bottlenecks, currency fundamentals, and key levels, to see if the rotations continue, or if they show signs of being fake rotations and start reverting back to trend.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Note</h2>
<p>Bitcoin has had volatile price action lately:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-btc-price.png" alt="BTC Price" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-btc-price.png 651w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-btc-price-300x195.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 651px) 100vw, 651px" width="651" height="423"></p>
<p>In my April 11th report, I wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is not a ton to report on as long as bitcoin remains over $50,000 and under $62,000. Until it either breaks down or breaks out, it’s just consolidating. My base case is for a break out, but for now we watch.</p></blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, bitcoin both broke out <em>and</em> broke down since then, which was somewhat unexpected. Bitcoin went up to about $64,000 to fresh all-time highs, but then corrected below $48,000, and has since been bouncing around the lower end of the range. At this point, bitcoin’s price has been in a two-month consolidation.</p>
<p>Looking at on-chain indicators, I remain bullish as my base case, but more risk has been brought into the market.</p>
<p>The ratio of market value to realized value (cost basis) cooled off a bit, and never did reach the feverish highs of previous major tops:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-btc-mvrv.png" alt="BTC MVRV Z-Score" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-btc-mvrv.png 634w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-btc-mvrv-267x300.png 267w" sizes="(max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px" width="634" height="712"></p>

<p>Long-term holders aren’t selling much; it’s the leveraged short-term traders that have been moving markets during the past week. Specifically, there were nearly $5 billion in leveraged liquidations on April 17th:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-btc-liquidations.png" alt="BTC Liquidations" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-btc-liquidations.png 662w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-btc-liquidations-300x272.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px" width="662" height="600"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/crypto-markets/futures/btc-liquidations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Block</a></em></p>
<p>This is another case where absolute and percentage numbers can make a big difference in terms of narrative. Five billion dollars in liquidations is a huge number, but it’s only 0.5% of Bitcoin’s market capitalization. These leveraged short-term traders, however, do affect bitcoin’s marginal price significantly in the near term since that’s where the volume is.</p>
<p>In terms of a support level, there is a big chunk of the cost basis that was traded around $47,000 during bitcoin’s run up. A price below there for a while would mean a lot of folks are selling at a loss. That’s a level for bulls to try to hold.</p>
<p>The Spent Output Profit Ratio is an approximate measure of whether bitcoin holders are selling at a loss or not, and that also shows that this $47k area is pretty important. The SOPR generally stays above 1 during bull markets, and brief dips below 1 generally represent bottoms in an otherwise upward price trend. Here is bitcoin’s price and SOPR since the May 2020 halving:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-btc-sopr.png" alt="BTC SOPR" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-btc-sopr.png 634w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-btc-sopr-300x204.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px" width="634" height="431"></p>
<p>Chart Source: <a href="https://glassnode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glassnode&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>If SOPR goes materially below 1 for more than a brief dip, it means a decent chunk of investors are selling at a loss, which historically happens in bitcoin bear markets. I still lean bullish here but it’s a fairly important level at the moment in regards to intermediate-term price projections.</p>
<p>Investors would do well to check their allocations to ensure that their position size is appropriate for their risk tolerance.</p>
<p><strong>GBTC Update</strong></p>
<p>The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) closed at a nearly -19% discount to NAV on Friday, which is its lowest ever.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-gbtc-discount.png" alt="GBTC Discount" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-gbtc-discount.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-gbtc-discount-300x185.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="400"></p>
<p>As investors may recall, back on December 22 and on February 16, I trimmed two separate 20% tranches from our GBTC position in the No Limits portfolio for risk management purposes. The first trim was at about $30, and the second trim was at about $50. The original position was purchased under $10.</p>
<p>In my view, this GBTC discount is due to new competition for bitcoin funds, compared to previous times when GBTC was one of the only options with little competition and thus had the ability to charge high fees. There is now a Canadian bitcoin ETF, a fund from Skybridge, and other ways for investors to access bitcoin. Most of them have way lower fees than GBTC, which is currently still priced as though it has no competition. Plus, exchanges and wallets have gotten easier to use, so investors can more readily buy bitcoin directly.</p>
<p>However, this deep discount has made GBTC rather attractive.&nbsp;Grayscale could close the discount by either converting to an ETF (which the US has not yet allowed, but is increasingly pressured to do), or by selling bitcoin to buy shares of the trust. GBTC is pretty interesting at current levels from a long perspective in my view.</p>
<h2>Portfolio Updates</h2>
<p>I have a few updates for changes I will make to the portfolios next week.</p>
<p>The full portfolios can be viewed in my Google Drive.</p>
<p><strong>Top 12 List</strong></p>
<p>-Replace MMM with BMY. I continue to like MMM, but at current levels, BMY appears more attractive between the two as one of the more conservative selections.</p>
<p>-Replace HDB with CI. I continue to like HDB as well, but CI is cheap relative to its growth potential and offers nice forward return prospects.</p>
<p><strong>Newsletter Portfolio</strong></p>
<p>-No current changes.</p>
<p><strong>Fortress Income</strong></p>
<p>-No current changes.</p>
<p><strong>ETF-Only Portfolios</strong></p>
<p>-No current changes.</p>
<p><strong>No Limits Portfolio</strong></p>
<p>-Sell HDB, and buy 20 shares of BMY and 5 shares of CI.</p>
<p>I still like HDB, but adding BMY to the portfolio presents a nice risk/reward contribution in my view, with relatively uncorrelated risks to the rest of the portfolio. The No Limits portfolio emphasizes a lower number of positions than the newsletter portfolio or fortress income portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>Other Holdings</strong></p>
<p>-I will buy shares of BMY and CI.</p>

<p>A number of healthcare stocks look reasonably attractive here.</p>
<p>In the middle of 2020, everyone was afraid of economically-sensitive stocks, so they plowed into tech stocks at any price, and caused a bubble there. And then as we got positive vaccine announcements and re-openings, investors began plowing into economically-sensitive reopening trades, pushing them up quickly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, healthcare stocks in aggregate have been in the middle. Unlike most sectors, most of their stock price charts don’t show that anything unusual happened in 2020 or 2021. Defensive perma-bears aren’t plowing into them, and neither are aggressive overly-bullish Robinhood traders.</p>
<p>Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), Warren Buffett’s company, bought billions worth of healthcare stocks in 2020, including Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) and Merck (MRK). Other than long-term value investors, there isn’t a lot of interest in the sector. I do like the sector here, with a 3-5 year outlook.</p>
<p><strong>Cigna Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Cigna (CI) is a large US health insurer. They purchased Express Scripts in 2018, which made them into a combined health insurer and pharmacy benefits manager.</p>
<p>Consolidation has been the general trend in the US health insurance industry. Cigna acquired Express Scripts. CVS (CVS) acquired Aetna. United Health (UNH) is huge and owns OptumRX.</p>
<p>Previously, Cigna had low net debt levels. They took on debt to acquire Express Scripts, but are now paying it down:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-cigna-net-debt.png" alt="Cigna Net Debt" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-cigna-net-debt.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-cigna-net-debt-300x185.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="400"></p>
<p>Cigna has an A- credit rating from S&amp;P, which is quite strong, and has a debt/income ratio that remains less than 3x their annual net income even at this relatively elevated level. The trend is in the right direction.</p>
<p>Cigna’s acquisition gave them diversification and larger cash flows. Now, they just have to keep plowing some of their cash flow into debt payoff, to reduce interest expense and boost net profits. This gives them rather clear growth metrics over the next few years, from consolidation alone on top of whatever growth they have.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-cigna-targets.png" alt="Cigna Targets" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-cigna-targets.png 596w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-cigna-targets-265x300.png 265w" sizes="(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px" width="596" height="675"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: Cigna Investor Day Presentation</em></p>
<p>Cigna targets 10-13% long-term EPS growth plus their dividend, which they recently raised to make it a real dividend of over 1.5% in terms of yield.</p>
<p>Even if they fail to meet that 10-13% target but still grow at 8%, plus a 1.5% dividend and a low current valuation, that’s a margin of safety for good performance. In other words, Cigna is part of the “value” side of the “growth-to-value” rotation which has been seemingly underway since September 2020. The price/earnings valuation is in the low teens:</p>

<p><strong>Bristol Myers Squibb Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Bristol Myers Squibb is one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical providers. In 2019, they acquired Celgene which greatly strengthened their drug pipeline and boosted forward cash flow projections by a lot. This helps offset declines from BMY’s older drugs.</p>
<p>Much like Cigna with their acquisition, BMY had to take on debt in order to complete its acquisition. They’re still digesting that move, but at least they went into this with a fortress balance sheet. Here’s BMY’s net debt over time:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-bmy-net-debt.png" alt="BMY Net Debt" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-bmy-net-debt.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-bmy-net-debt-300x185.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="400"></p>
<p>The company has an A+ credit rating from S&amp;P, and tons of annual free cash flow to service the debt, pay dividends, and buy back shares.</p>
<p>So far, it appears that BMY’s acquisition is paying off. Analysts expect massive earnings increases over the next few years:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-bmy-fastgraph-1.png" alt="BMY FASTGraph" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-bmy-fastgraph-1.png 966w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-bmy-fastgraph-1-300x180.png 300w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-bmy-fastgraph-1-768x461.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 966px) 100vw, 966px" width="966" height="580"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs</em></p>
<p>The stock currently pays a dividend yield of about 3%. If it raises earnings and dividends as expected, it’ll be hard for the stock price to stay where it is. At $66/share, it’s currently at a 10x price/earnings ratio. At $8.43 in expected earnings for 2023, a 10x price/earnings ratio would be $84.</p>
<p>This situation is a “fundamental cross”, and reminds me of the AmerisourceBergen (ABC) stock chart from last year. This is excerpt and chart is from our February 2, 2020 deep dive report:</p>
<blockquote><p>ABC stock currently trades at an adjusted P/E ratio of about 12, which is below its long-term historical average of over 16. Its chart pattern is what I refer to as a “fundamental cross”.</p>
<p>A fundamental cross is when the price of a stock gets ahead of fundamental earnings growth (overvalued), and then chops along sideways or down for a few years as earnings eventually catch up and surpass the stock price. In this sense, the fundamentals eventually catch up and “cross” the stock price to the upside. If this continues, the fundamentals eventually drag the stock price up to break its consolidation pattern.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2020-2-2-abc-fg.png" sizes="(max-width: 1004px) 100vw, 1004px" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2020-2-2-abc-fg.png 1004w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2020-2-2-abc-fg-300x174.png 300w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2020-2-2-abc-fg-768x446.png 768w" alt="ABC Stock FAST Graph" width="1004" height="583"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Like BMY, ABC was previously overvalued but then became cheap as fundamentals outpaced the price for a while. And like BMY, ABC had a long-term lawsuit hanging over it to some degree.</p>
<p>Well, here’s how ABC has performed since that February 2020 report:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-abc-fastgraph.png" alt="ABC FASTGraph" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-abc-fastgraph.png 966w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-abc-fastgraph-300x180.png 300w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-abc-fastgraph-768x461.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 966px) 100vw, 966px" width="966" height="580"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs</em></p>
<p>Fundamentals stayed on track with mild improvements above expectations, and eventually ABC’s stock price was forced to catch up, otherwise it would have a silly-low valuation for insufficient reasons.</p>
<p>ABC notably outperformed the S&amp;P 500 since that report until today, about 15 months later. It fell way less than the broad market during the COVID-19 crisis in March 2020, and then after the recovery has a positive performance gap of nearly 1700 basis points.</p>
<p>Not all stocks work out that well or that quickly. I certainly have my fair share of both disappointing stocks and outperforming stocks.</p>
<p>However, I like to see a “fundamental cross”, where an otherwise solid company see its stock price go sideways while its earnings grow. Eventually, someone is wrong, either analysts or the market, and it’s often the stock price which has to correct upwards in order to make sense again. And if it’s a dividend stock, it pays the investor while she waits to let the outcome play out.</p>
<p>Focusing back on BMY, if we do a basic two-stage <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/stockdelver-book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StockDelver</a> analysis, even with conservative estimates, we can get to 10% returns going forward:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-bmy-stockdelver.png" alt="StockDelver BMY" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-bmy-stockdelver.png 680w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-bmy-stockdelver-300x176.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" width="680" height="399"></p>
<p><strong>CI and BMY Risks</strong></p>
<p>Healthcare stocks have long been weighed down by regulatory concerns, as their biggest risk factor.</p>
<p><em>US Regulation and High Costs</em></p>
<p>The United States pays by far the highest per-capita costs on healthcare in the world, but with below-average life expectancy and infant survival ratios. We’re a global outlier vs our developed peers. There are a lot of factors under the surface here:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-health-outlier.png" alt="Health Outcomes" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-health-outlier.png 813w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-health-outlier-277x300.png 277w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-health-outlier-768x830.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 813px) 100vw, 813px" width="813" height="879"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/us-life-expectancy-low" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our World in Data</a></em></p>
<p>With a divided Congress and a lot of political interests backed by corporate donors, the US has not been focused on reducing healthcare costs for its citizens compared to other countries. We also have higher average obesity rates. For as long as that combination remains the case, I’ll likely remain bullish on healthcare companies.</p>
<p>Inversely, a big risk to healthcare companies, and especially US healthcare insurance companies, would be single payer healthcare in a similar fashion to what many other developed countries have. That remains off the table for the foreseeable future, at least until 2024 or perhaps 2028, but that’s a long-term risk worth monitoring for healthcare stock investors.</p>
<p>The Biden Administration is mostly in favor of the current healthcare system, and a tightly-divided Senate can keep the current system in place as long as there is no filibuster-proof majority, which is rare and would require a huge election sweep.</p>
<p>There are individual smaller bills worth watching as well. Democrats <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3684755-house-democrats-reintroduce-bill-to-lower-drug-prices" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have put forth a bill</a> a couple of times now that would cap seniors’ out-of-pocket annual expenses towards prescription drugs at $2,000/year. This would have big implications for pharmaceutical companies but is unlikely to get through the current Senate.</p>
<p><em>Company-Specific Lawsuits</em></p>
<p>As a specific risk, BMY has two potential lawsuits hanging over it.</p>
<p>Three weeks ago,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/business/bristol-myers-taxes-irs.html" rel="nofollow">the NYT reported</a> that the BMY may owe well over $1 billion in taxes due to an alleged offshore patent scheme. That’ll play out with the IRS over time and we’ll see how it goes.</p>
<p>Secondly, BMY is facing litigation related to milestones that were attached to its 2019 Celgene acquisition. If certain drugs were all approved by the FDA by certain dates in 2020, then BMY was contractually obligated to pay “contingent value rights”.</p>
<p>However, approval of one of the drugs by the FDA was delayed, apparently due to COVID-19, so contractually BMY does not owe that money. However, approval came a little over a month after the required date, so in the grand scheme of things, although not the letter of the contract, one could argue that the money would have been owed in normal circumstances. The holders of the CVRs may have a case for litigation to get at least partial value, on top of lawyers taking their cut for pursuing the case. This is potentially worth several billion dollars.</p>
<p>All together, the upper end of this combined litigation is in the mid-to-high single digit billions for BMY. That sounds like a lot and it is, but at the top end of bad outcomes, that’s about 1 year’s worth of projected forward BMY net income and about 5% of BMY’s market cap. Plus, BMY has $16 billion in cash on hand, which is more than enough. And much or all of it might not come to fruition against BMY.</p>
<p>There’s a big spectrum of outcomes, with the worst of which being a rather painful year for BMY but not in any way an existential issue in the sense that it threatens solvency or ongoing ability to generate and grow its cashflow. Mainly, the outcome of these cases will affect how much extra cash BMY has available to buy back shares with, which gives us a variance as it relates to fair value estimates.</p>
<p><em>Price Competition</em></p>
<p>Health insurers have relatively little pricing power. However, they benefit from network effects, and so the top several companies with the largest negotiation power and widest medical networks tend to do very well, but competition remains fierce. Besides the tail risk of major regulation, pricing pressure and maintaining margins remains the key challenge for companies like Cigna.</p>
<p>This is why I like to diversify my healthcare exposure. For pharmaceuticals, I like Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY), Merck (MRK), Amgen (AMGN), and Johnson and Johnson (JNJ). For insurers or pharmacies, I like Cigna (CI), CVS (CVS), and United Health (UNH). In general, most of the healthcare sector is cheap, with strong balance sheets, and little economically-cyclical exposure. There’s not much reason to take on too much company-specific risk, but there are good reasons to spread bets on a few companies in the industry.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>The past year has been a strong ride up, with several rounds of stimulus and a big recovery from a low bottom.</p>
<p>In year-over-year rate of change terms, most economic data still look positive out to the end of this quarter. By the third quarter, however, there are more risks of economic indicators slowing down.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the year-over-year increase in margin debt is the second highest in recent history, only eclipsed by the dotcom bubble in 2000. Investors are levered long:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-margin-debt.png" alt="Margin Debt" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-margin-debt.png 645w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-4-25-margin-debt-300x187.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 645px) 100vw, 645px" width="645" height="402"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: <a href="https://www.yardeni.com/pub/stmkteqmardebt.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yardeni</a></em></p>
<p>It’s certainly a time for portfolio reflection when it comes to assessing equity valuations and considering risks such as tax changes or policy tapering. That’s one reason I like the relatively defensive and cheaply-valued healthcare industry here, and why I like having a globally-diversified set of assets.</p>
